    The Wrights Hill Fortress Restoration Society formed in 1992, with the aim
    of preserving and restoring the Fortress. We also took over running the Open
    Days from the Lions. As part of our ongoing restoration of the Fortress, we
    hold weekly working bees, at which general maintenance and restoration
    activities are done.  The Restoration Society is made up of people with many
    interests. Some work on restoration, some research the history, others work
    on the administration of the project, some help on Open Days, and some
    members simply support the Society through their donations and other
    activities.
