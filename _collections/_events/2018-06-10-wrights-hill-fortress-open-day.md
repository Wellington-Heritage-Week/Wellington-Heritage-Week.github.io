    The Wrights Hill Fortress Restoration Society formed in 1992, with the aim
    of preserving and restoring the Fortress. We also took over running the Open
    Days from the Lions. As part of our ongoing restoration of the Fortress, we
    hold weekly working bees, at which general maintenance and restoration
    activities are done.  The Restoration Society is made up of people with many
    interests. Some work on restoration, some research the history, others work
    on the administration of the project, some help on Open Days, and some
    members simply support the Society through their donations and other
    activities.

Built in 1942 to protect Wellington from Japanese bombardment, Wellington’s historic Wrights Hill Fortress in Karori will be open for public inspection again on Labour Day, Monday October 22nd.

People are invited to self-guide themselves through the tunnels and gun emplacements. The walk usually takes about one hour and there will also be a number of guided tours during the day. Bring a torch with you for some fun!

Visitors will be able to explore the 620 metres of underground tunnels with a free map and history pamphlet. They will see the engine room, shell stores, plotting rooms and the huge gun pit where Gun Number 1 used to stand, as well as a replica of the 10 metre-long gun barrel.

New additions at the Fortress are replica 9.2 inch shells and replica canisters which used to hold the gun powder “charge” bags.

Also on show will be historic photos, and an assortment of military weapons. A DVD of how a 9.2-inch gun operates will be showing as well.

All proceeds go to the continuing restoration of the Fortress. 

**No booking is required.**

**Location:** 50 Wrights Hill Road. Access is via Karori Road, Campbell Street, and Wrights Hill Road. There is limited car parking at the summit of the Hill.

**Cost:** $8 per adult; $5 per child. $20 for a family of two adults and three children under 15.
