#### 'World through Rose Coloured Glasses': Public Talk

On Sunday 31 October at 2pm, third-generation Seatounian Bob Rowell will present a talk titled 'World through Rose Coloured Glasses', which details his team's refurbishment of leadlights and stained glass windows in many well-known Wellington landmarks. 

Bob grew up in Seatoun in the 1950-60s and his love of stained glass was inspired from an early age from viewing the stained glass windows in St Christopher’s during Sunday School and at his Burnham Street home. In his talk, he will share how he gave up his profession as a Registered Civil Engineer to follow his passion and dreams of working in stained glass.

He has worked on glass at Parliament House and The General Assembly Library, St James Embassy and Bats Theatres, Government Buildings, Government House, Star of the Sea Convent Chapel (Seatoun Heights), many churches and historic homes. Bob and his son built the large mural wall of stained glass in Te Papa Marae.

Come along to the talk to hear more about Bob's work and chat about stained glass.
