**Scattered around the attic at Old Government Buildings is a graffiti library of historical signatures.** 

Our two tours on 25 October are a rare opportunity for visitors to read and photograph the graffiti, hear the amazing stories behind each piece as well as tales of the resident ghosts. Each visitor will also have the chance to wind the time or the chime on the building’s wonderful historic clock. 

You’ll need to be quite agile, 12 years of age or older, and not afraid of the dark, to attend this tour. Booking is essential because each tour is limited to 12 people. Booking is through Eventbrite – the tour is free if you’re a Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga member, or $15 per person (+ booking fee) for non-members.
