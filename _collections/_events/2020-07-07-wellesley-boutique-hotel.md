**Step back in time with the Category 1 Heritage-listed Wellesly Boutique Hotel in central Wellington.**

The building was designed by architect Gray Young and completed in 1929 and is associated with the Wellesley Club, an establishment that has been important to the social and business life of the capital city for over 100 years. It is one of the finest examples of neo-Georgian architecture in Wellington. 

Each room is spacious and includes claw foot baths, a writing table, free WiFi, Sky TV, and access to the in-house *1815 Cafe & Bar*.

The Wellesley Boutique Hotel began in 1891 when 150 prominent citizens of Wellington established a gentlemen’s club known as the Junior Wellington Club. Several of its founders were the sons of members of the original Wellington Club. Some years later the Club was renamed the Wellesley Club after Arthur Wellesley, the legendary Duke of Wellington, victor at the Battle of Waterloo. The Duke’s family allowed the Club to use his family coat-of-arms.

Book direct with the hotel to save 10% off the elsewhere listed price.

Perfect for a heritage escape in the heart of the city.
