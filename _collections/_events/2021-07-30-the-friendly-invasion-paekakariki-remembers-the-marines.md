**In 1942-43 Paekakariki district hosted three large camps, holding 15,000 young Americans infantrymen: Camp Mackay, Camp Paekakariki and Camp Russell. Their construction was a New Zealand epic, achieved in less than two months by the combined efforts of Public Works Department and Master Builders Federation.**

The Marines trained on beaches, dunes and farms between Paekakariki and Raumati, often in dangerous conditions. They were welcomed into their homes by locals and brought new foods, manners and sights to wartime New Zealand. Leaving these camps they sailed from Wellington to the Battle of Tarawa, where over 1000 of ‘our boys’ died and many were wounded.

The story will be told in cooperation between three groups: Paekakariki Station Pecinct Trust, Kapiti US Marines Trust and Paekakariki Community Trust. A feature will be images and films by US camera-man Norm Hatch that have never before been seen in New Zealand.

Make a day of it, viewing exhibits, walking the campsites, and enjoying delicious food from Beach Road’s cafes!
