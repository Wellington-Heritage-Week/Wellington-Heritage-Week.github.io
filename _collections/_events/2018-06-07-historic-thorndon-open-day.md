_Visit three historic residences in Thorndon: a combined Open Day at the Randell Cottage, Lilburn House and the Rita Angus Cottage._

All three residences will be open to the public for the afternoon of Sunday 28 October. Visitors will be able to walk through each one as they are very close. A simple map will be available to show the route.

The **Randell Cottage** located at 14 St Mary Street, a Category II historic place built in 1867, will be open for visits with readings by a writer and a casual afternoon tea from 2.30pm. The Randell Cottage is a representative example of an early settler dwelling in Wellington. Since 2001 it has been a writers’ residency. In partnership with the Embassy of France, the New Zealand-France Friendship Fund, the Wellington City Council and Creative New Zealand, the Randell Cottage Writers Trust provides a six-month residency each year to a French and NZ writer respectively.

The Category 1 Heritage Listed former home of one of the country’s foremost composers, the **Lilburn Residence** located at 22 Ascot Street, will be open for visitors. Visitors can explore the cottage where the composer Douglas Lilburn (1915-2002) lived and worked, as well as the garden. Described as a ‘Mecca for composers, musicians, and artists alike’, the house is of importance to those influenced by Lilburn and his contribution to the development of New Zealand music. The house and garden (Lilburn's 'jungle', which includes a fine shed) will be open to visitors to hear some of his music, and learn about the history of the property and the composers who have worked there. 

The former home of critically acclaimed artist **Rita Angus** (1908-1970) located at 194A Sydney Street West, constructed in 1877 and now a Category 1 listed building, will be open to visitors. There will be tours of the cottage and the garden by the Thorndon Trustees and the volunteer gardeners. The cottage, the garden (including the magnolia), Thorndon and Wellington all feature in Rita Angus's work. The artist-in-residence program is a part of the legacy that Angus has left to contemporary New Zealand art.
