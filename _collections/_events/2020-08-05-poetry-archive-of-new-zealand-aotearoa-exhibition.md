**What has poetry NZ Aotearoa achieved in the last 380 years? See it all on display at the Poetry Archive of New Zealand Aotearoa.**

Poetry Archive of New Zealand Aotearoa (PANZA) is an original idea developed by Paekakariki poet/publisher/bookseller Michael O’Leary in 1999. Since then, a considerable archive has been collected in that time.

From 2006-2008 PANZA received public funding to assist the popular poetry series of “Winter Readings” at the City Gallery through the Wellington City Council and Creative NZ’s Creative Communities Scheme. It has now moved into setting up its archive in a more publicly accessible format.

Around 5,000 titles are in PANZA’s online catalogue. Depositors to the Archive include Niel Wright (Original Books), Mark Pirie (HeadworX Publishers), the late poet/anthologist Harvey McQueen, Helen Rickerby (Seraph Press), Alistair Paterson (Auckland, editor of Poetry NZ), poet John Ellis (New Plymouth), Roger Steele (Steele Roberts), Cecilia Johnson and Michael O’Leary (Earl of Seacliff Art Workshop).

The Poetry Archive is situated in a brand new weatherproof garage in Northland, Wellington.

A reader’s table, paper, pencils, and comfortable reading chairs are provided for those wishing to read material during their visit to the Archive.

Poetry Archive of New Zealand Aotearoa offers:

* Copies of NZ poetry books for private research and reading purposes.
* Historical information for poets, writers, journalists, academics, researchers and independent scholars of NZ poetry.
* Photocopying for private research purposes.
* Books on NZ poetry and literary history, and CD-ROMs of NZ poetry and literature.
* CDs of NZ poets reading their work.
