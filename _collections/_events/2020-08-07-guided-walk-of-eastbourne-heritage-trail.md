**Join the Historical Society of Eastbourne on a guided walk of the Eastbourne Heritage Trail.  A guide will explain the stories of the community and its past.** 

The Eastbourne Heritage Trail officially opened in February 2018, and was the culmination of two years’ work by the Historical Society of Eastbourne, the Eastbourne Community Trust and other community organisations, with the support of the Eastbourne Community Board and Hutt City Council. 

The trail consists of 15 display stands spaced at intervals along the waterfront between “The Village” (Rimu Street) and Korohiwa, at the south end of Eastbourne. Each display features photographs and text about a particular aspect of Eastbourne’s history.

The guided walk is on Friday, 30th October, starting at 10 am. Walkers are asked to gather outside the Eastbourne Library at 9.45 am so we can set out promptly at 10 am. The walk takes about 2 ½ hours one way, which assumes a leisurely pace and plenty of time to look at the displays and other points of interest along the way.
