**“How hard is it to escape from places. However carefully one goes they hold you – you leave little bits of yourself fluttering on the fences – like rags and shreds of your very life.” Katherine Mansfield in a letter to Ida Baker, 1922**

Explore the Thorndon that Katherine Mansfield knew and the traces of her legacy that remain in the landscape today. Beginning with a short introductory talk at Katherine Mansfield House & Garden, the guided walking tour will include a visit to the architecturally impressive Parliamentary Library where Mansfield spent many afternoons reading, and finish at the National Library for a special viewing of Mansfield-related objects from the Alexander Turnbull Library’s collection.

A collaboration between Katherine Mansfield House & Garden and the National Library Te Puna Mātauranga o Aotearoa. With thanks to Thorndon School Te Kura o Pipitea, Old St Paul’s and Parliamentary Service Te Ratonga Whare Pāremata.
