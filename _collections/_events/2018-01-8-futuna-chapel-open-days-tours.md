**Open Days - 11am-3pm Monday 22 Oct to Friday 26 Oct**

The Futuna Trust is pleased to open Futuna Chapel to the public from 11am to 3pm everyday during Wellington Heritage Week 2018. 

Futuna Chapel, which opened in 1961, is a unique building and a landmark in the history of modernism and biculturalism in NZ architecture. It was designed by architect John Scott for the Society of Mary as a retreat chapel. It received a Gold Medal for its architect as well as the inaugural 25 Year Award from the New Zealand Institute of Architects.

In addition to the inspiring architectural design, the Chapel contains works that form an integral part of the building created by artist Jim Allen, including the Stations of the Cross, the coloured perspex windows, the light modulators above the entry doors and the carved Christ Figure.

_No booking is required for the Open Days._

A guided tour of the Chapel will start at 3:00pm on Saturday 27 October, and 11:00am on Sunday 28 October.
