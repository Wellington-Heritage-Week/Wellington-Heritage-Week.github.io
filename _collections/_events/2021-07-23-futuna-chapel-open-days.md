**Futuna Chapel, one of the jewels of Wellington's built heritage, will be opened to the public over the Wellington Heritage weekend.** 

This building is widely regarded as the masterwork of its architect, the late John Scott of Haumoana and is a synthesis of Maori, European and NZ Pakeha building traditions. This synthesis is greatly enhanced with the embedded work of eminent NZ sculptor Jim Allen. 

The restoration of his Stations of the Cross frieze after 63 years (completion due by 8th October by Studio Izzo), will be 'unveiled' to the public for the first time. The Chapel is open to be explored and trustees will be on hand to welcome visitors, answer questions and help reveal the Chapel's secrets and stories.

**No booking is required.** 

**Location:** Futuna Chapel 67 Futuna Close (off Friend Steet) Karori

**Cost:** A koha would be appreciated
