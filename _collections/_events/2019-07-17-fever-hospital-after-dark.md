    SPCA has been in Wellington for over 130 years and now has pride of place in
    the old Fever Hospital in the green belt on Mount Victoria. As well as space
    for animals to be rehomed, SPCA’s Wellington Centre, known as the Margaret
    Doucas Animal Hospital has a full veterinary hospital providing care for the
    animals in the community as well as those in SPCA care. With a focus on
    community engagement and proactive solutions to animal needs, there is also
    the opportunity to hire areas of the Centre for functions and events.
