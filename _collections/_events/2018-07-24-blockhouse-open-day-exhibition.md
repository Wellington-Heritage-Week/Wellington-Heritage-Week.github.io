Visit Upper Hutt's historic Blockhouse and its special exhibition between 11am-3pm on Sunday 28 October. 

Built in 1860 during the New Zealand Wars to protect colonial settlement in the Hutt Valley, the Blockhouse is one of very few of its type remaining in NZ. It never saw action, but was used as a Police House and Court House between 1868 and 1876. 

The exhibition explores the unique history of the Blockhouse, the site, and the New Zealand Wars in the Hutt Valley. The exhibition was curated by Expressions Arts and Entertainment Centre.

A visit to the National Rifle Association at Trentham is also recommended on Sunday 28 October to view NZ’s oldest sporting trophy – The Ballinger Belt –another Wellington Heritage Week 2018 event)
