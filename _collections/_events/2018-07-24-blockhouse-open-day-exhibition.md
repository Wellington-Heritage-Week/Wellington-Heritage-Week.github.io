Visit Upper Hutt's historic Blockhouse and its special exhibition between 11am-3pm on Sunday 28 October. 

Built in 1860 during the New Zealand Wars to protect colonial settlement in the Hutt Valley, the Blockhouse is one of very few of its type remaining in NZ. It never saw action, but was used as a Police House and Court House between 1868 and 1876. 

The exhibition explores the unique history of the Blockhouse, the site, and the New Zealand Wars in the Hutt Valley. The exhibition was curated by Expressions Arts and Entertainment Centre.

**No booking is required.** _Booking is requested for groups larger than 10 people._ 

**Location:** Blockhouse Lane off McHardie St, Upper Hutt (in the grounds of Heretaunga College)

_A visit to the National Rifle Association at Alexander Road , Trentham is also recommended on between 11am-3pm Sunday 28 October to view NZ’s oldest sporting trophy – The Ballinger Belt –another Wellington Heritage Week 2018 event._

Structured long range target shooting matches started in 1862 and Trentham still hosts the annual National Championships for the Ballinger Belt. In late January 2019 the Ballinger Belt Championship will be followed by the World Championships (the Palma Trophy) when 7 possibly 8 countries will compete. The Belt and other trophies together with photos of past winners including coverage of the 1995 Palma Trophy held at Trentham will be on display. An external overview of the range will be included.
