***Standing still, still standing Deanna Dowling***

Standing still, still standing uses photographic documentation, archival imagery and text to explore the vacant Gordon Wilson Flats and modern architectural value systems. The project invites viewers to consider the relationships between people, place and structure. 

What will win: preservation or progress?

A New Zealand first, Courtenay Place Park light boxes form a highly public exhibition space in the midst of Wellingtonâ€™s central city environment. The eight 3-metre high steel and glass LED light boxes were designed as an integral part of the Courtenay Place Park and were unveiled in May 2008. 

The light boxes encourage people to reflect on this busy and diverse urban centre, even if just for a minute. Each exhibition lasts for four to six months.
