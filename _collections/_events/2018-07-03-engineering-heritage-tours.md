**Wellington Heritage Walking Tour** (approximately 2 hours)

Engineering has been important in creating Wellington – a geographically constricted capital city on shaky ground.

This tour helps you explore some of central Wellington’s engineering history and heritage. Tour stops include historic places, such as the famous Cable Car and take you to Lambton Quay and the waterfront.

Using each tour’s map and accurate directions, you can navigate your way around featured places, learning about New Zealand’s engineering legacies and the people that have made them happen.

Each tour has text descriptions of engineering places, illustrated with historic and recent photographs, and featuring website links for those interested in exploring the subjects further.

For complete offline accessibility simply download the tours you are interested in before you step out the door.
