**Come visit St James’ Church for talks, a concert, and an open day from Lower Hutt Archives and St James’ Church community groups.**

Laura, Senior Advisor for the Hutt City Archives, will share a brief overview of the history and significance of the Lower Hutt Civic Centre Historic Area, a heritage-listed area, which includes Riddiford Park, War Memorial Library, Town Hall and administration building, and St James’ Church and graveyard. 

Liz Friend from St James' Church will also talk about the St James' church precinct and recently upgraded church graveyard, where many Lower Hutt dignitaries have been buried since 1845.

The talks will be the first hour of each event. 

A special concert will happen on Thursday 28 October at 12:30pm after the talk. 

The church and a display about the church will be avaliable for viewing between 11:30am–5pm on Thursday, and 2pm–5pm on Saturday.
