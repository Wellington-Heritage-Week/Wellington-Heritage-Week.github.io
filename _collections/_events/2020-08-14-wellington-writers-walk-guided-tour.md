**The Wellington Writers Walk is made up of a series of 23 quotations from well-known and much-loved New Zealand writers, including poets, novelists, and playwrights, all of whom have (or had) a strong connection to Wellington City.** 

This guided walk will provide an opportunity to discover some of these plaques and benchmarks with a group of like-minded fans. 

The tour will explore parts of Wellington waterfront, between Te Papa and Frank Kitts Park, led by two Wellington Writers Walk Committee members, both Wellington writers. They will be happy to share their passion for this iconic project and answer any of your questions. 

There will be time for readings, so feel free to bring your favourite quote about the Coolest Little Capital to share with us. The event will last one and a half hours and offers an introduction and an overview of the Writers Walk. 

The walk will begin at Te Papa and you are asked to assemble outside the main doors of Te Papa to begin the tour. This is an outdoor event and will only be cancelled in case of really bad weather, so please be aware of weather conditions and dress accordingly with appropriate footwear. The walk is on the flat, along the waterfront, but access to some plaques involve steps.

Limited to 20 people on each tour.
