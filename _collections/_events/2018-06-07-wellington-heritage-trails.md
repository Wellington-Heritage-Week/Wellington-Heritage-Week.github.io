Explore the following trails: 

**Te Ara o Tupuna**

Immerse yourself in the history of Wellington’s original Māori residents whose culture, settlements and industry have helped shape our capital’s identity.

**Maritime Trail**

Starting at Shed 21 on Waterloo Quay, the trail follows
 the waterfront round to Oriental Bay, passing many former
 Wellington Harbour Board buildings.
 Highlights include the fine brickwork of Shed 21 (built in
 1910), the late English Classical style Queens Wharf Offices
, and the Art Deco Post and Telegraph Building on Herd Street.

**Old Shoreline Trail**

This trail takes you as close as possible to Wellington’s
 former shoreline.
 Start your walk at the seaward corner of Herd Street and
 Oriental Parade. Fourteen brass plaques set in the paving
 along the route show where the shoreline was in 1840.

**Art Deco Trail**

The inter-war period was a rich time for Wellington architecture, with 200 new non-residential buildings constructed between 1919 and 1939, 30 of which you can see on this trail. 

**World War 1 Heritage Trail**

Follow some World War 1 procession and parade routes in Wellington from the Parliament precinct to the National War Memorial and Carillon, the Basin Reserve and beyond.

_All trails are easily negotiated by wheelchair._

**This is a self guided event through the online and physical brochures. No booking is required.**
