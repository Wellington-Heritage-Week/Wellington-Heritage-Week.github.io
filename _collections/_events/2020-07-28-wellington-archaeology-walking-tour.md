**Have you ever wondered about what lies beneath our city? Here’s your chance to take a walk through central Wellington with an experienced archaeologist!** 

On this walking tour, Mary O’Keeffe will tell us what archaeological investigations have revealed about our city. 

Two tours are on offer, starting from outside Te Papa’s shop window: a tour for the general public is on Tuesday 27 October at 10am; and there is a schools tour on Wednesday 28 October, at 10am. 

These are free tours but numbers are strictly limited so booking is essential. You can book by emailing dwatt@heritage.org.nz at Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga. 

Please specify whether you are interested in the public or schools tour. Each tour will take approximately 1.5 hours, so comfortable walking shoes and weather appropriate clothing/protection is essential.

Tour begins from outside Te Papa on the concourse (meet outside the Te Papa shop window). The tour finished at the PWC building on the waterfront, near the railway station.
