**The School of Philosophy (Inc) invites the Wellington community to an Open Day at the historic building of Philosophy House Aro St on Saturday 31 October.** 

This lovely 1913 heritage building was formerly owned by the New Zealand Salvation Army for training purposes. The School of Philosophy purchased the building in 1982 and uses it for non-profit educational purposes.

Â·The Georgian-style brick building was built in 1913 by the architects, Fearn & Quick. In 1927 the partnership won the inaugural NZIA Gold Medal Award for its design of the William Booth Memorial Training College, as it was then known. Architectural drawings are displayed inside the building.

The School has just completed extensive earthquake strengthening of the building upstairs with more work to carry out downstairs next year.  

The rooms are well used in the evenings and weekends for Philosophy classes. It is now available for hiring for community functions such as lectures, concerts, book launches, and training seminars.

Since 1956 the School of Philosophy in Wellington has been presenting the great teachings of the world in a way that is meaningful in daily life. Such topics as wisdom, decision-making, awareness and beauty are explored. Today, there are schools in many countries around the globe
