**Visit Upper Hutt's multi-award winning Pioneer Cottage Museum, showcasing how the first settlers lived from the 1860s. "A time capsule in our own backyard".**

**Also, see a display telling the story of the earliest hotels in the area - the Barley Mow at Silverstream, the Mungaroa Inn at Te Marua, the Golden Fleece at Pakuratahi (Kaitoke), the Criterion
 in Upper Hutt, and more.**

The well-preserved Category 2 Heritage -listed Cottage and outside Foodstore and wash house contain many interesting artifacts, most of them owned by the original Golder family. They are sure to evoke memories for older visitors and have the youngsters marveling at how children lived 143 year ago - without electricity or inside plumbing!

The Criterion Hotel in Upper Hutt township relates to the Golder family through Cottage Matriarch Jane Golder.

The many other hotels reflect the history of Upper Hutt and the valley.
