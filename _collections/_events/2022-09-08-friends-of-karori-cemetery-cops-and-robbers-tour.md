**Cops and Robbers Tour. In collaboration with the NZ Police Museum we are proud to launch Cops and Robbers.**

The Cops and Robbers Tour is all about those who committed crimes and paid the ultimate penalty, the gaoler who witnessed some of their hangings, the lawyers who defended or prosecuted them, the police who investigated and laid the charges, a couple of victims, a judge or two, policemen who were shot while on duty, and a Police Matron.


Join this tour to learn more about them all, and explore the fascinating Karori Cemetery.
