**This is a once-in-a-year opportunity to visit this wonderfully restored colonial cottage and its exuberant summery garden.** 

Come and marvel at the small rooms that once proudly housed a family of ten children. The cottage has architectural and historical significance as a representative example of a single-detached working-class dwelling built in nineteenth-century New Zealand.  It was built in 1867 by William Randell, a stonemason from Dorset and extended around 1874 to meet the needs of his growing family.

In 1994 William’s great-granddaughter Beverley Randell, a writer, purchased the cottage with her husband Hugh Price and their daughter Susan. They carefully restored the cottage and a collection of household items found during the renovations is held in the collection of Te Papa Tongarewa. In 2001 the cottage was gifted to the Randell Cottage Writers Trust, which works with partner organisations to host one French writer and one New Zealand writer each year.

See how the cottage has been sympathetically preserved to retain its original style, yet updated to be a home for writers in residence from New Zealand and France. 

Join the Trustees and Friends of Randell Cottage over a free afternoon tea and listen to a selection of readings from local writers.

*The event is organised as part of a walking tour in collaboration with Lilburn House and Rita Angus Cottage.*
