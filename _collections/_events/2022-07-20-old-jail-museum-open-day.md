**Come to the Old Jail Museum – a well-preserved former lockup. See an exhibition on Policing in Petone from 1840.** 

It also has other Jackson Street and Petone stories, as well as information on Jackson Street businesses, Petone walking tours, kids activity sheets, and more to take away. 

Built in 1908 on Elizabeth Street, it was once the most senior station in the Hutt Valley with four constables and one sergeant. In the early 1950s, the Police Station and Jail were moved behind the old courthouse at 13 Elizabeth Street. Police used the courthouse as an office, but the lockup continued to be used – mainly for intoxicated offenders – until 1978.
