  blurb: Wellington Vintage Machinery was established in 1987 when one of the
    locals enlisted the help of another to get a small Lister engine operating
    that he had rescued from his grandfather's milking shed. With the engine
    operating, these men plus another realised that they had a common interest
    in rescuing, restoring, and operating old engines so they formed a Club.
    Since then many old machines large and small, and other interesting items
    have been saved from the scrap heap and brought back to life. Many of the
    smaller machines are taken out to public events.

**Get a close up look at vintage machinery and test your knowledge and operating skills at Wellington Vintage Machinery Incorporated. You will see vintage machinery, tractors, and have a hands on experience to get them operating.** 

Find out what was used to make the 1950 Empire Games medals. Many machines have an association with the Wellington area! 

Also take a nostalgic trip through the vintage kitchen and other displays of household, and retail items from the past. Wellington Vintage Machinery is housed in a former cheese factory built in 1925. 

The factory has had an interesting past from cheese factory to milk bottling plant, to munitions store during the Second World War and other uses before becoming home for the vintage machinery. 

The building is one of a few remaining dairy factories designed by architects Duffill & Gibson of Hawera and built by CE Roebuck of New Plymouth.
