**On Saturday 30 October (10am to 2pm) Philosophy House at 33 Aro Street will be open to the Wellington community to celebrate Wellington Heritage Week.** 

This is a great opportunity to come and see this lovely building. There will be powerpoint presentations and tours about the building during the day. 

This 1913 heritage building in Georgian style won New Zealand's inaugural Architecture Award. It was built by the New Zealand Salvation Army for training purposes, and has been the Wellington base of the School of Philosophy (Inc) since 1982 for non-profit educational purposes. 

The School has completed extensive earthquake strengthening of the building on level one with more work to be carried out on the ground floor as soon as we can raise the funds. This year we have asked for a koha on entry.

Tours are 20-30 minutes; powerpoint presentations 30 minutes.
