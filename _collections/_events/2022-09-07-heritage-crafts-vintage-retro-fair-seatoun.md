**This year we are excited about what is on offer to celebrate Wellington Heritage Week. From 10am, both St Christopher’s and the Village Hall in Seatoun will be a hive of activity.**

Wander through St Christopher’s church, designed by William Fielding in the Romanesque Revival style and built in 1932. Marvel at the unique stained glass windows and the original features.

Between 11.00am – 12pm in the church, embroidery artist Cathrine Lloyd will talk about the inspiration and the historical embroidery techniques used in her exhibition, The Disappearing Woman. Inspired by Surrealism, her work is full of twists that disrupt expectations and refashions the familiar into something from a dream. Have a closer look at some of her intricate and inspiring work.

Next door in the hall we are bringing together some of the finest crafters from around Wellington who not only display their heritage crafts but will be working on their ongoing work. There will be an opportunity to try things for yourself and gain some tips from these experienced crafters.

The crafts in action include embroidery, lacemaking, tatting, spinning and weaving and more.

At the same time in the Village Hall there will be stalls selling a wide variety of good quality vintage and retro clothing, homewares and curios.

For more detailed information about the various crafts and demonstrations please visit our Facebook page [@seatounevents](https://www.facebook.com/seatounmarkets) or our [website](https://www.seatounvillage.co.nz/blog/).


We look forward to seeing you.
