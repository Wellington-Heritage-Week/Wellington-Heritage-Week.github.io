**Join Walk Tours NZ on two historic walking tours that explore the formative years of the LGBTI Rainbow community in Wellington.** 

### **Resonance Route (Te Aro) - 1pm Saturday 30 Oct *SOLD OUT***

This tour gives you an opportunity to be transported back to earlier days to discover stories of rainbow courage and resilience while standing in the locations where it all happened. 

We'll visit the site of Carmen's curio shop, stop by the infamous Club Exotic, talk about a poetic same-sex romance, visit the site of the discreet Dorian Society and more.

**Location**: Meet outside of Thistle Hall, 293 Cuba Street

<br>

### **Violet Route (Parliament) - 1pm Sunday 31 Oct *SOLD OUT***

Learn about homosexual law reform, the beginnings of rainbow radio broadcasting, local LGBTI rainbow personalities, supportive (and not so supportive) churches, a WW1 same-sex love story and imprisonment on Matiu Somes Island.

**Location**: Meet at the flagpoles on the steps of Parliament
