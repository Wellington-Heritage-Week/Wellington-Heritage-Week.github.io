**The Lilburn House at 22 Ascot St, Thorndon, is a heritage-listed modernist bungalow that was for many years the home of composer Douglas Lilburn. It is now managed by the Lilburn Residence Trust who make it available to a composer-in-residence (currently Jerome Kavanagh).**

During Wellington Heritage Week we open the house and garden to visitors. There will be some music in the house.

Our Open Day is offered in conjunction with similar events hosted by the Randell Cottage Trust and the Rita Angus Cottage Trust. Visitors (provided with a map to facilitate) can walk from one artist's cottage to another in the course of the afternoon.
