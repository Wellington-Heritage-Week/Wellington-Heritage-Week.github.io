**Wellington’s Old St Paul’s is a heritage gem. A notable example of timber Gothic Revival architecture, the 1866 former Anglican pro-cathedral’s soaring timber arches and glowing stained glass are a sight to behold. Old St Paul’s recently reopened after a year-long earthquake strengthening project, and is ready to face the next 150 years!**
