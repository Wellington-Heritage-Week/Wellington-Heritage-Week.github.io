**Embark on a tour of Matiu/Somes Island with the Eastbourne Forest Rangers for Wellington Heritage Week 2021.**

As the "spittle in the mouth of the fish of Maui" the three harbour islands begin Wellington's story. 

The tour covers the islands' discovery, first peoples, the dislocations and relocations of the early 1800's, immigration, quarantine, and war-time internments. It also illuminates the islands' forest restoration, endangered species and their recovery, and the awesome landscape forces of the harbour.

The Eastbourne Forest Rangers are volunteers interested in recreation and conservation. 

Meet at the Matiu/Somes Island Wharf.
