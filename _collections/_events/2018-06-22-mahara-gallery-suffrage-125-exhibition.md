To mark the 125th anniversary of women's suffrage in New Zealand Mahara Gallery is mounting three special shows dedicated to women artists with a Kapiti connection. 

**Being female here now**

_Being female here now_ features several Kapiti-based artists including two leading figures of the development of Maori women's art and feminist art in the late 1970s and early 80s, Robyn Kahukiwa and Diane Prince.

**Frances Hodgkins: Three Works: Three Decades**

This show presents three paintings by Frances Hodgkins (1869 -1947) which explore the development of her practice over three decades, through her trip to Europe in 1901, to the modernist approach she had developed by the 1920s.

**Sophie Saunders: Solo Show**

Sophie is an abstract painter who works from her home in Waikanae. Trained at the Elam School of Fine Arts, University of Auckland (MFA Painting 1992), her main interests are colour, shape and the communication of a sense of the ineffable.

**No booking is required.**

**Location:** Mahara Gallery, 20 Mahara Place, Waikanae

**Cost:** Free
