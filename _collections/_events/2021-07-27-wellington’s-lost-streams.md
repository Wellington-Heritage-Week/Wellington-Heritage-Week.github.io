**Join us for an exploration of the lost urban streams in the capital and learn a little of their history and future as they compete with the frantic demands of our urban jungle.**\
\
Scientist Evan Harrison, Ecological Engineer, Stu Farrant, and a former Chief Storm Water Advisor, Ben Fountain, will tell the story through the lenses of Kumutoto, Waimapihi, and Waitangi Streams as we stroll from the site of Wellington’s first ‘piped stream’ and onto the waterfront reflecting on the issues and challenges with the future of our city’s freshwater.\
