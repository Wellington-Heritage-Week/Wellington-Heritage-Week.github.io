**Maritime Archaeology Association of New Zealand (MAANZ) in conjunction with the Maritime Heritage Trust of Wellington (MHT) offer a public tour of the floating crane *Hikitia* moored at Taranaki Street Wharf.**

*Hikitia* is a working self-propelled floating steam crane built in 1926 and is thought to be the only working steam crane of her type in the world. Onboard the vessel is the MAANZ Conservation Laboratory. 

Built and manned by volunteers since 1997 the Lab produces museum standard conservation of artefacts. We know of no other Conservation Lab on an historic ship in the world. 

The tour will commence with a briefing, followed by a walk around the ship including viewing the Conservation Laboratory. Tours take about 60 to 90 mins.

**Participants must book their place on the tour by emailing  ​maritimeheritagetrust@gmail.com​ by 5pm on Friday 30 October 2020.** 

Tour groups will be a maximum of 10 people.
