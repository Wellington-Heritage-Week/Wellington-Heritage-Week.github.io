**Discover the stories of Old St Paul’s, its changing neighbourhood and its people, at a talk liberally illustrated with historic images and film.**\
\
Since 1866, Old St Paul’s has stood on Mulgrave Street while the landscape around it has changed – the once nearby shoreline became distant through land reclamation, and surrounding countryside and pā turned to an urban neighbourhood. Old St Paul’s itself has transformed over time from the centre of Wellington’s Anglican Church, to a building surplus to requirements, and then to a place for all people to enjoy and for significant life events to be celebrated.\
\
Over the years, the evolution of Old St Paul’s and its Thorndon/Pipitea surroundings has been captured on camera, along with some notable moments in Wellington’s history in which Old St Paul’s has played a role. Join us for a visual exploration of this small but significant corner of the capital.\
