**Visit Christ Church in Taita, Lower Hutt. It is the second oldest church in New Zealand and the oldest in the Wellington Region. Christ Church was built by pioneer families and held its first service on 1 January 1854.** 

The beautiful grounds and historic graveyard are a must-see for those interested in, or who have a connection to, New Zealand early history. 

Visitors will recognise the names of many of the streets in the Hutt Valley on the headstones in the graveyard. Their names – Avery, Boulcott, Buck, Daysh, Harris, Hooper, Hirst, Kemble, Mabey, Peck, Percy, Riddler, Welch and Matangi (the son of a signatory to the Treaty of Waitangi) are still well known in the Hutt Valley.

Christ Church is still a consecrated church and is frequently used for, weddings, baptisms and funerals, in addition to special services arranged by the Preservation Society.

There will be guided graveyard tours at 1.00 and 2.00 pm.
