**Enjoy a three course meal and view a wide selection of beautiful works by Rita Angus throughout the hallways and lobby of the Bolton Hotel.**

Known for combining the essence of New Zealand with the artistic movements of Europe and North America, Rita Angus succeeded in forging her own distinct, personal style as one of Aotearoa's most significant 20th-century artists.

The event will provide an exclusive insight into the woman behind the easel as you join Warwick Angus, the  Managing Director of the Bolton Hotel and nephew of the renowned artist as he shares the fond memories of his extraordinary aunt, over a three-course meal from Artisan at the Bolton.

The event includes a 3-course set-menu dinner and welcome drinks on arrival from 5pm. Dinner from 5:45pm. 

Maximum 20 people. 

Adjacent to the historic Bolton Street Cemetary, Wellington's earliest cemetery, Bolton Hotel is named after one of the first immigrant ships to arrive in New Zealand in the 1800s; a replica model of the ship can be seen in the hotel lobby.
