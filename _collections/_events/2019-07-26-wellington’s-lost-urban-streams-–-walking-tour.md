**Join the Engineering New Zealand and The Sustainability Society for a walk to rediscover the streams that flow beneath our city. **

We will wend our way from Woodward Street, where the Kumutoto Stream runs in a pipe beneath the paved city streets, out to the harbour and along the waterfront. Many of Wellington’s streams only re-emerge as they enter Wellington Harbour. 

Fresh water is essential to our health and wellbeing. Hear about the social, cultural and engineering aspects that have shaped our relationship with Wellington’s streams. Reflect on past changes and what the future could hold. 

The tour has a capacity of 30 people.
