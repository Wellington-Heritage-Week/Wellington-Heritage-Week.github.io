**Experience Virtual Reality at the Wellington Museum with Immersive Legacies: 320 The Terrace.**

“Immersive Legacies: 320 The Terrace” is an interactive exhibition that explores how New Zealand’s heritage can be captured digitally and disseminated through various evolving digital technologies such as Virtual Reality, 180° spherical projections, and 360° videos.

Accompanying this intriguing experience, are banners of historic and technical information, 3D printed and laser-cut building models to give an overview of what Digital Heritage can offer.

Visitors can explore the high-rise modernist building on 320 The Terrance and discover its story as a 1950s vision of social housing to a controversial icon of our city’s past.
