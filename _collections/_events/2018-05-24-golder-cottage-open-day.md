Location: 707 Fergusson Drive, Upper Hutt

Upper Hutt's multi-award winning Pioneer cottage Museum, showcasing how  the first settlers lived from the 1860s and how the house developed to accommodate "citification" into the 1980s, is dubbed "a time capsule in our own backyard". 

The well preserved Cottage and outbuildings contain many interesting artifacts, most of them Golder- family-owned,  that are sure to evoke past memories for older visitors and have the youngsters marvelling at how children lived 142 years ago- without even their own bed and with no electricity for digital devices!
