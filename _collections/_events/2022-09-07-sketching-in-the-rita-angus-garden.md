**The garden at the Rita Angus Cottage (Category 1 historic place) will be open to visitors, who are encouraged to stay and sketch the abundant array of flowers and plant life that surround the 1877 cottage where New Zealand artist Rita Angus lived between 1955 and 1970, providing her with much inspiration and subject matter.**

Rita Angus Cottage Trustees and volunteer gardeners will be on hand, with drawing material and reproductions of some of Rita's representations of her Thorndon garden. Some materials will be provided. You are also welcome to bring along your own pens, pencils, pastels and watercolours â€“ and perhaps a picnic.

The house continues as a studio for an artist-in-residence programme and is a part of the legacy that Rita Angus has left to contemporary New Zealand Art.
