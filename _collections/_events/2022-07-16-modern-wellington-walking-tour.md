**Hear the stories of Wellington’s important mid- to late-twentieth century buildings, structures and places on the Modern Wellington Walking Tour. We’ll explore a new area of town from previous years, learning about the huge changes, culture shifts, and controversies that went along with all that concrete, steel, and glass!** 

This year the tour focuses on the parliamentary precinct, starts at 1pm on Sunday 31 October, and attendees are encouraged to gather from 12:45pm near Pipitea Marae on Thorndon Quay. 

This is a free walking tour, but booking is essential by emailing: [infocentral@heritage.org.nz](mailto:infocentral@heritage.org.nz). Please be sure to specify you want to attend the Modern Wellington Walking Tour when you contact us at Heritage New Zealand. 

The tour will take approximately 1.5 hours, up stairs and hills, so comfortable walking shoes and weather-appropriate clothing and protection is essential.
