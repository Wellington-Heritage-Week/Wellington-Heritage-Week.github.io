**Come and visit the historical Romanesque Revival style St Christopher’s Church in Seatoun, nestled beneath pohutukawa trees and only a stone’s throw away from the beach. Hear the history of the church and take in the beauty of the stained glass windows. **

Sold by the Presbyterian Church in 2015, it is now privately owned but leased by a charitable trust to ensure that it is still available to be enjoyed by locals on the Peninsula and beyond. 

Whilst the doors aren’t often open, it continues to be used for weddings, funerals, community events and the like. 

There will be a variety of musical performances throughout the day with an organ recital at 2pm on the original Tracker organ by members from the Wellington Organists’ Association.
