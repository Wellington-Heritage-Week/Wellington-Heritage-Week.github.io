Wellington's wind-buffeted airport is on land uplifted from the sea by earthquakes. 

In Māori tradition, the harbour was once a lake occupied by two taniwha (supernatural creatures). One of the taniwha created the harbour entrance by breaking out to the open sea. Polynesian navigator Kupe is also believed to have visited Wellington Harbour.
