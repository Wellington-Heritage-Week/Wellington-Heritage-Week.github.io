**We are celebrating Heritage Week with a drawing tour â€“ and that is all we are saying!**

Bring along your preferred materials, and we will take you to surprise locations throughout central Wellington, filling your sketchbook as you draw inspiration from Wellington's heritage sites.

In the week before the tour, we will send you heritage clues that will disclose the meetup spot.

Please bring your drawing materials and walking shoes. Open to all skill levels and abilities. Bookings are essential.
