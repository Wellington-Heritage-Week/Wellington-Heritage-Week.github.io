St Christopher’s Church is notable for the quality of its design, materials and craftsmanship, and for the well-considered neo-Romanesque decorative scheme. The building has a historic association with the Presbyterian community of Seatoun.

In 1913 a Presbyterian church hall was opened in Seatoun where it was served by a home missionary. In 1932 a new church, St Christopher’s, was built to the design of William Fielding. The foundation stone was laid on the 6th of April 1932, by His Excellency Lord Bledisloe, the Governor-General.
