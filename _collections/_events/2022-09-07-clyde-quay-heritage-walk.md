  blurb: Wellington Classic Yacht Trust is a registered charitable trust (CC49281)
    formed in 2010 dedicated to the preservation, restoration and above all,
    sailing of small vessels with a significant history to Wellington and the
    region. We primarily operate out of Clyde Quay on Oriental Parade,
    Wellington. We exist to share our passion for the history of these vessels
    and the sport of yachting with the wider community; and encourage ownership
    and use of such vessels to ensure their continued useful existence. Gavin
    Pascoe is a maritime historian and current chair of the Trust.

**This iconic spot is perhaps the most photographed area in Wellington, popular with locals and visitors.**

Woven into this space is well over a century of NZ life; it has been a haven to refugees and a springboard to adventure. Learn about the architecture, hear some of the stories, get a peek into some of the sheds, and finish up with a refreshment at the RPNYC rooms.
