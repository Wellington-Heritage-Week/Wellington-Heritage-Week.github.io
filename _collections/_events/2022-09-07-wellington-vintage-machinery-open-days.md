**Get a close up look at vintage machinery and test your knowledge and operating skills at Wellington Vintage Machinery Incorporated. You will see vintage machinery, tractors and have a hands on experience.**

Find the machine that was used to make the 1950 Empire Games medals. Many of the machines have a association with the Wellington area.

Take a nostalgic trip through the vintage kitchen and other displays of household, and retail items from the past. Wellington Vintage Machinery is housed in an old Cheese Factory built in 1925. The factory has had an interesting past from cheese factory, to milk bottling plant, munitions store during WWII, and other uses before becoming home for the vintage machinery.

The building is one of the few remaining dairy factories designed by architects Duffill & Gibson of Hawera and built by CE Roebuck of New Plymouth.
