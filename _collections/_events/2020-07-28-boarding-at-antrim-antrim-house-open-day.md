**Atop its grand hill, Antrim House sits proudly among the towering office buildings and student halls of Boulcott Street. Did you know that Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga’s national office was once a boarding house?**

Between the 1950s and 1970s, Antrim House served as a home for many young men who have gone on to shape Aotearoa New Zealand. They lived together in this stately home under the watchful eyes of staff; living lives that were in some way not so unlike that of our local students today!

While this period and its occupants have long been under-represented in the building’s lengthy history, this open day on Monday 26 October, from 11am-3pm, gives you the chance to learn their stories (no booking required).

These young men came from many different backgrounds. Some were fresh off the boat from Europe and the Pacific, others were rural Pākehā and Māori who had moved into the city for work.

Online material and a tour have been developed from records, images and interviews with Antrim Old Boys. Come along and learn what life was like for the diverse group of Antrim House boarders.
