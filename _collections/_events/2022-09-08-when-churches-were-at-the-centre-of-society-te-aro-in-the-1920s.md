**In the 1920s, more than 90% of European New Zealanders expressed affiliation to a Christian denomination. One hundred years later, by contrast, nearly 50% of the population claim to have ‘no religion’ at all.**

The Wellington City Mission began as an initiative of St Peter’s Anglican Church in 1904 and focused on the overcrowded ‘slums’ of Te Aro. Richard Norman will provide a context of Te Aro of the 1920s, including a new model of streets and buildings of that era. Today’s Wellington City Missioner, Murray Edridge, will describe how the Mission is reinventing its work currently, and discuss parallels and differences between the 2020s and 1920s.

There will also be church services at **8am and 10am**. These will use prayers and music from the 1920s, and visitors are welcome.

The talk itself will begin at **11:30am** and can be attended without first being at the church service.

*This event is free, but koha is welcome for maintenance of St Peter’s church, opened in 1879.*

*This is a change of speakers from the originally advertised programme. Assoc. Professor Geoff Troughton is not now able to present on October 30.*

<br>

**No booking required.**

**Location:** St Peter’s Church, corner of Ghuznee and Willis Streets, 211 Willis Street. Church services are live streamed via Facebook.

**Duration:** The 11:30am talk will last 50 minutes. The 8am church service will last 45 minutes, and the 10am service will last 80 minutes.

**Cost:** Free / Koha
