**In 1920, more than 90% of European New Zealand’s adhered to a Christian denomination in contrast to nearly 50% of New Zealanders who now who have ‘no religious affiliation’.**

Associate Professor Geoff Troughton, programme director of religious studies at Victoria University of Wellington will discuss how church was interwoven with society, using Te Aro as an example of a ‘mission’ area for churches, including the City Mission which was started at St Peter’s in 1904.

A model of Te Aro ‘slum’ housing from the period will be unveiled.

There will also be church services at **8am and 10am**, which will celebrate ‘All Saints Day’ in the church calendar through using music and prayers from the 1920s and celebrating ‘saints’ from that era.

The talk itself will begin at **11:30am** and can be attended without first being at the church service.

*This event is free, but koha is welcome for maintenance of St Peter’s church, opened in 1879.*

**Location:** St Peter’s Church, corner of Ghuznee and Willis Streets, 211 Willis Street. Church services are live streamed via Facebook.

**Duration:** Church services will be around 30-60 minutes. The 11:30am talk itself will last 60 minutes.
