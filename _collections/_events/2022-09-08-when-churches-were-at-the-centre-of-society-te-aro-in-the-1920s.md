**In the 1920s, more than 90% of European New Zealanders expressed affiliation to a Christian denomination. One hundred years later, by contrast, nearly 50% of the population claim to have ‘no religion’ at all.**

Associate Professor Geoff Troughton, programme director of Religious Studies at Victoria University of Wellington, will explore the social role and ministry of the churches during an era of their predominance, with special reference to Te Aro.

This was the context of the City Mission’s work, which began as an initiative of St Peter’s Anglican Church in 1904.

A model of Te Aro ‘slum’ housing from the period will be unveiled.

There will also be church services at **8am and 10am**. These will use prayers and music from the 1920s, and visitors are welcome.

The talk itself will begin at **11:30am** and can be attended without first being at the church service.

*This event is free, but koha is welcome for maintenance of St Peter’s church, opened in 1879.*

**No booking required.**

**Location:** St Peter’s Church, corner of Ghuznee and Willis Streets, 211 Willis Street. Church services are live streamed via Facebook.

**Duration:** The 11:30am talk will last 50 minutes. The 8am church service will last 45 minutes, and the 10am service will last 80 minutes.

**Cost:** Free / Koha
