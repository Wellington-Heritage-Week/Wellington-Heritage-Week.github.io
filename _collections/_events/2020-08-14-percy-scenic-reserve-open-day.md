**Come celebrate Percy Scenic Reserve’s historic and botanic legacy at our open day.** 

Wander through the beautiful lawns, gardens and walkways and picnic on the lower lawn area. The waterwheel and the mill pond tell the story of a young developing colony. The previous site of Sir James Hector’s home, ‘Ratanui’ connects this place with Aotearoa New Zealand’s esteemed organisations such as Te Papa Tongarewa and The Royal Society. 

We will be running guided tours of the special plant collections all day, and there will be self-guided heritage walks with informational material.  Kiosks and displays will provide people with historical insights to the important role that the park has played in the history of the area. Learn about important people who lived close by, such as Hōniana Te Puni-kōkopu, Sir James Hector, and others. 

The Lower Hutt Horticulture Society will be hosting information about native plants that can be used in your own gardens. And Mountains2Sea will be showing demonstrating the diversity of organisms that can be found in the waterways. Please click [here](http://mountainstoseawellington.org/events/)to find more information about their talks. 

The Hutt City Council Community Ranger will also be on site to talk about how people can protect the natural heritage in their own back yards.

*Percy Scenic Reserve is completely smokefree. No dogs are allowed in the park, and it’s not suitable for mountain biking.*
