**Armistice Stories from Upper Hutt - A tale of 3 ladies**

Written and researched by noted researcher and genealogist Lynly Yates, we will tell the stories in the first person of three Upper Hutt women affected by the First World War: 

May Maud Banks, who lost her brother, 2nd Lieutenant Henry Dunbar Banks, regimental number 37098. Annie Louisa Stanley (nee Banks), who lost her husband and brother. And Alice Verna Stanley who lost her father, Private Thomas James Stanley regimental number 72/4094. 

The display will tell their stories because it is close to Armistice Day on November 11.

Attendees can also explore the cottage during their visit.
