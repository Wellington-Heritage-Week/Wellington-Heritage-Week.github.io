**Hear the stories of Wellington’s important mid- to late-twentieth century buildings, structures and places on the Modern Wellington Walking Tour.**

We’ll explore a new area of town from previous years; learning about the huge changes, culture shifts and controversies that went along with all that concrete, steel and glass!

This year the tour starts at 1pm on Sunday 30 October, and attendees are encouraged to gather from 12:45pm outside the Public Trust Building, corner of Lambton Quay and Stout Street.

This is a free walking tour, but booking is essential. Please find booking details below.

The tour will take approximately 1.5 hours, so comfortable walking shoes and weather appropriate clothing/protection are essential.
