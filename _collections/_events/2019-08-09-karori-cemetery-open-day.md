**Friends of Karori Cemetery will be hosting visitors keen to explore and learn more about the second largest cemetery of New Zealand, and about many of the interesting and influential people buried since 1891.**

The two heritage listed buildings in the Cemetery â€“ the Mortuary Chapel and the Small (crematorium) Chapel, will both be open, and there will be talks throughout the day about the stained glass windows in the latter. 

Commissioned from a workshop in Dublin between 1913 and 1939 these windows are hidden gems of the stained glass art world. 

There will also be 45 minute guided walking tours around the oldest heritage areas of the cemetery at 11.30, 12.30, 1.30 and 2.30, and self-guided information about some interesting people buried further away. 

**There will be an official launch of the Friends at 3.00pm (including a lolly scramble for the kids!).**

**Location:** Karori Cemetery, 76 Old Karori Road, Karori
