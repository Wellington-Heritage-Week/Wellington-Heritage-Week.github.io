**Combined Open Days at Randell Cottage, Lilburn House and the Rita Angus Cottage - the homes of New Zealand writers, composers, and artists.**

Join us on Sunday 1 November for an afternoon celebrating art, music and literature at three historic Thorndon creative residencies.

Randell Cottage, Lilburn House and Rita Angus Cottage will be open to the public from 1 to 4pm.

Visitors can enjoy refreshments and readings from Randell Cottage writers, music at Lilburn with birthday cake to celebrate what would have been Douglas Lilburn’s 105th birthday, and the opportunity to explore or sketch in the lovely Rita Angus Cottage garden.

These three heritage properties are in easy walking distance of each other in Thorndon.

Randell Cottage (Heritage Category II), built in 1867 as the family of home of William and Sarah Randell and their ten children, is now a writer's residence for New Zealand and French writers. The current resident is Michalia Arathimos, who will be present to read from her novel-in-progress, Cartographia, described as an exploration of place, migration and identity through the eyes of a New Zealand woman of Greek descent.

Lilburn House (heritage Category I), where composer Douglas Lilburn lived and worked, is now a residence for New Zealand composers. There will be music at 2 and 3 pm.

The Rita Angus Cottage (Heritage Category I) was home to the celebrated New Zealand artist between 1955 and 1970. The abundant flowers and plant life surrounding the 1877 cottage inspired much of Rita Angus' work. Thorndon Trustees and volunteer gardeners will be on hand, with drawing materials and reproductions of some of Rita’s representations of her garden.

Koha would be appreciated at each of the residences.
