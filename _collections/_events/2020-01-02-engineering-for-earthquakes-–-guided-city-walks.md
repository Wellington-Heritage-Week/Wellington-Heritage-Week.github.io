**Join engineering experts on two guided walking tours through Wellington's seismic past, where the hidden stories of familiar buildings will be told through advancements in engineering ingenuity.** 

As Wellington has grown and developed, so has our understanding of the impact of earthquakes on buildings. Approaches to earthquake strengthening are varied, and many of our significant buildings have undergone various iterations of seismic resilience upgrades to protect them. The walks will include buildings you pass every day and will uncover "how did they do that?" feats of engineering. 

Historically, New Zealand in general and Wellington, in particular, has been one of the epicentres of earthquake engineering technology, research and development. The tour will reveal evidence of different generations of development and implementation, often hiding in plain sight. 

While the walks will cover the history and present condition of recognisable and unfamiliar buildings and locations, they should also inspire attendees to think about the future of the city.

Each tour explores a different part of the city – one looking at locations around Te Papa and Te Aro, the other covering locations close to Parliament.
