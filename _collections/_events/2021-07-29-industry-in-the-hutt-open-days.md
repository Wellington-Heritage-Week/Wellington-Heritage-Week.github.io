**Lower Hutt has a long history of industrial enterprise going back to the 19th century, including car assembly, food production, and a woollen mill.** 

Join Hutt City Libraries and the Petone Settlers Museum for a showcase of items and resources highlighting these local industries from around the Hutt. 

Share your memories and stories of local industry with us to be recorded for future generations. 

Bronwyn Lloyd is interested in your stories of the Petone Woollen Mills and Wellington Woollen Manufacturers for an exhibition at the Petone Settlers Museum next year. Staff from Hutt City Libraries are keen to hear memories of other local industries.
