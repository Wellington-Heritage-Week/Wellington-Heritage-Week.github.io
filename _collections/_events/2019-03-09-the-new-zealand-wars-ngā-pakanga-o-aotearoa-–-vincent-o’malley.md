**Fought between the Crown and various groups of Māori between 1845 and 1872, the wars touched many aspects of life in nineteenth-century NZ. They are an integral part of NZ history but we have not always cared to remember or acknowledge them. The clarity of O’Malley’s writing enables us to understand the events, causes and consequences of these defining conflicts and encourages us to ‘hear, read and embrace the difficult aspects of our past.’**

**Me maumahara tatou. We should remember.**

Publisher: Bridget Williams Books
