**There is growing recognition for the heritage value of modern buildings around the world. But is this the case in New Zealand?** 

Join us for a free talk delivered by architectural historian, Julia Gatley. She will discuss how New Zealand measures up in terms of heritage recognition for modern architecture. Are modern buildings well represented on our heritage lists? And what do we risk if we undervalue the history and heritage of these important twentieth-century buildings? 

Associate Professor Julia Gatley, Acting Deputy Dean of Creative Arts and Industries at the University of Auckland. Julia is an architectural historian, with a particular focus on twentieth-century architecture. 

She has written widely on New Zealand architecture, and her books include The Auckland School: 100 Years of Architecture and Planning, Vertical Living: The Architectural Centre and the Remaking of Wellington, Athfield Architects, Group Architects: Towards a New Zealand Architecture, and Long Live the Modern: New Zealand’s New Architecture, 1904-1984
