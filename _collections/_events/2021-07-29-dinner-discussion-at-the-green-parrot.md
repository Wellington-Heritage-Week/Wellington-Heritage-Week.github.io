**Hosted at the Green Parrot, food historian, Cuisine restaurant critic, and lecturer at Le Cordon Bleu, David Burton will tell the story of the 'Hellenic Mile'.**

\
Join him as he explores the development of New Zealand's relationship with food through the lens of the greek businesses that pioneered restaurant eating in New Zealand.

\
Located in the historic Green Parrot, couched in history, decorated in paraphernalia, and run by icons of Wellingtons 'foodie' history, Kosta and Angelo Sakoufakis, be prepared to step back in time and be regaled by a fascinating and un-sung story.
