**Head to Karori and visit the Wrights Hill Fortress on Labour Day. Self-guided tours last about one hour and there's plenty to see from the second world war including a DVD of a huge 9.2 inch gun in action, historic photos, and WW11 firearms.** 

The underground tunnels include an engine room, ammunition stores, plotting rooms, radio room, and 620 metres of tunnels, all lit and safe. The huge gun pits give you an idea of how large the guns were, installed in the 1940's to defend Wellington from a Japanese invasion or bombardment! 

Limited car parking at the top of the hill- refreshments available. 

**CASH only** - no EFTPOS facilities - sorry. Bring a torch for some fun, and strong footwear.
