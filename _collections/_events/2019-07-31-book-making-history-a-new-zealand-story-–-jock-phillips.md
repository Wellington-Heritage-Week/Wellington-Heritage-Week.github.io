description: >-
  In this wonderfully complex memoir, Jock Phillips delves deep into his own
  history and how he came to find power in the documentation of our country’s
  history. ‘I tried to encourage… forms of history that would awaken public
  interest.’ This is as much a story of the revolution of New Zealand identity
  as it is a man looking back on his journey of self-discovery.
