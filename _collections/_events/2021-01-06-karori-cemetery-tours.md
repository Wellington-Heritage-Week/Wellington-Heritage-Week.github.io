  blurb: "The Friends of Karori Cemetery Inc was formed in early 2020. The
    organisation has its genesis in the guided tours researched and provided by
    Barbara Mulligan trading as Karori Cemetery Tours over many years, and in
    the extensive community project Barbara led in 2018 for the centennial
    commemoration of those who died and were buried in the Karori Cemetery
    during the 1918 flu pandemic.  We are a wholly volunteer-based organisation
    with an elected Committee which provides leadership and governance.  Our key
    purposes are: to support the preservation, protection, and enhancement of
    the heritage, recreational, and ecological aspects of the Karori Cemetery;
    to advise and assist the WCC in its efforts to achieve this; to promote
    public interest in the Cemetery; to support and undertake research into the
    history of the Cemetery and those interred in it."
