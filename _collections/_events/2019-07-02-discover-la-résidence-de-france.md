**Come to la Résidence de France, the house of France and the dwelling of French Ambassadors in New Zealand.**

This elegant house was built at the end of the 19th century and bought by France in 1999. This historic building is regarded for its leadlight windows. 

In 2018, after a long refurbishment, respectful of the original features yet with modern furniture contrasting with the character of the villa, the residence was finally reopened. 

Dinners and cocktails are frequently held there, offering the opportunity to share French culture and a taste of French cuisine. 

Free guided tours of the property will be held on Friday 1st November from 10am to 3pm (5 tours are available. Each tour will start on the hour from 10am). 

The tour will take about one hour and the visitors will be welcomed at the gate, before a specialist of local history takes them for a visit of the house. 

The entrance to the property is at 39 Hobson Street, Wellington. On-street parking only. 

More details about the event can be found on Facebook and Twitter as well as on the website of the Embassy. 

For more information, please contact the cultural department of the embassy.
