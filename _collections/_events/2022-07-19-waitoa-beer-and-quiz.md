**A lineup of specially brewed, historically inspired beers brewed as a collaboration between Waitoa Social Club and Victoria University of Wellington.** 

Each of the beers will reflect a moment in our national past: a recipe drawn from the early 20th century, a re-invigorated 'New Zealand Draught' inspired by the days of the 6 o'clock swill, and finally an Aotearoa Pilsner, a recently recognised international beer style that represents just how far we've come. All of these beers will be launched on Labour day at Waitoa Social Club. 

Accompanied by a quiz that will test your knowledge of New Zealand history, beer, and all the ephemera associated with our unique and slightly bizarre relationship with the brown stuff.
