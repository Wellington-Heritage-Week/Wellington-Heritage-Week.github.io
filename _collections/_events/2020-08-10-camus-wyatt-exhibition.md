***Time is the longest distance* brings visual slices of Wellington’s public past into the bustle of today’s streets. Inspired by the richness of the photographic archives of the Alexander Turnbull Library, artist Camus Wyatt has selected and photographed fragments of negatives from the library’s vast collection.** 

Unexpected details of city life on the streets of Wellington over the last 100 years are remade as light box images in Courtenay Place Park. From revellers to protestors, filmmakers to pedestrians battling with the weather - Time is the longest distance reawakens the history of the places we walk every day and considers the people who have walked them before. 

**A series of eight double-sided 3-metre high steel and glass LED light boxes for the exhibition of art in public space.**

The exhibition transforms memory and historic preservation into a contemporary art experience. By selecting individual moments of Wellington life over time, Wyatt invites viewers to connect with the images as a shared past. Time is the longest distance creates a snapshot of our history as Wellingtonians, and highlights the relevance and importance of preserving our collective memories.

The light boxes are situated in Courtenay Place Park on the corner of Courtenay Place and Taranaki Street.
