    Housed in the old Waikanae Post Office is the Kapiti Coast Museum. Its
    nucleus began at the end of 1981 when a small group of radio enthusiasts
    decided it was tragic to see old radio sets being discarded and so they
    collected and stored pre-war (World War II) equipment in their garages.
    Along with radio and communications equipment, including a Ham Radio
    “Shack”, the museum is now home to extensive displays of everyday life from
    the pioneering era. The name changed to Kapiti Coast Museum Incorporated in
    April 1993 and the building, which opened as a post office in 1908, is now a
    Category 2 New Zealand Heritage Building.

Come to the Kapiti Coast Museum to see two special displays!

The displays will be to commemorate the 125th Anniversary of the gaining of the vote for Women in New Zealand in 1893 and a display of the Waikanae Hack Racing Club that existed from 1904 to 1914.
