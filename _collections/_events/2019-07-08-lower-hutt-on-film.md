**Join us to step back in time to see how the Hutt Valley grew through a screening of archival footage.** 

See how WW1 soldiers returned to be rehabilitated in Petone, new Plunket rooms opened, shops and housing transformed Naenae, and new industries brought families and the Kiwi-dream to the valley. 

The archival footage is sourced from Arhives New Zealand and the Petone Library Heritage Centre. 

Screening starts at 7pm and runs until 8pm, Wednesday 30 October.
