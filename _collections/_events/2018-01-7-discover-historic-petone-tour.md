Enjoy historic Petone at your own pace and learn about how Petone became the first European settlement in New Zealand. 

Despite early setbacks such as flooding and earthquakes – resulting in many settlers relocating to the other side of the harbour to establish Wellington – the people of Petone soon built a thriving community of houses, shops and industries.

Take the tour with you and download the Petone Tours app on Google Play or iTunes today and listen or read two self guided tours of the fascinating stories behind New Zealand's first organised European settlement:
