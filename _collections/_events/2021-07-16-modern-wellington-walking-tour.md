**Hear the stories of Wellington’s important mid- to late-twentieth century buildings, structures and places on the Modern Wellington Walking Tour. We’ll explore a new area of town from previous years, learning about the huge changes, culture shifts and controversies that went along with all that concrete, steel and glass!** 

This year the tour focuses on the parliamentary precinct, starts at 1pm on Sunday 31 October, and attendees are encouraged to gather from 12:45pm near Pipitea Marae on Thorndon Quay. 

This is a free walking tour, but booking is essential by emailing: infocentral@heritage.org.nz. Please be sure to specify you want to attend the Modern Wellington Walking Tour when you contact us at Heritage New Zealand. 

The tour will take approximately 1.5 hours, up-stairs and hills, so comfortable walking shoes and weather appropriate clothing/protection is essential.
