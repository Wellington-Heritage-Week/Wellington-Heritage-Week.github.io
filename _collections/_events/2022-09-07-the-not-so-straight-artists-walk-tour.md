We’ll feature writers Katherine Mansfield and Frank Sargeson, artists Dorothy Richmond and Francis Hodgkins, musicians Douglas Lilburn and the Glamaphones choir, international visitors Rupert Brooke and Somerset Maugham, and visit what is widely considered the most homoerotic sculpture in Wellington.
