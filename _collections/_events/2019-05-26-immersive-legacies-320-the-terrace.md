**Experience Virtual Reality at the Wellington Museum with Immersive Legacies: 320 The Terrace.**

Immersive Legacies: 320 The Terrace is an interactive exhibition that explores how New Zealand heritage can be captured digitally and disseminated through various evolving digital technologies such as Virtual Reality and 180Â°spherical projection. 

Attendees can explore the high-rise modernist building and discover its story as a 1950s vision of the future of social housing to a controversial icon of our city's past.    

The Gordon Wilson Flats are used as a case study of Wellington modernist architecture with heritage value.
