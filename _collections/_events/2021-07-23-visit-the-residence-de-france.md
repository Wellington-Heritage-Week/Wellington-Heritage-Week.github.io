**This villa from the 19th century, purchased by the Republic of France in 1999, is the home of the French Ambassador while posted in New Zealand.** 

As a local historic building, with its distinctive leadlight windows, the Résidence de France is an integral part of Thorndon’s heritage. 

Five free guided tours of the property will be held on Friday 29 October from 9:30am to 3pm. 

Visitors will be welcomed at the gate, before a specialist of local history from the Thorndon Society takes them for a visit of the house.
