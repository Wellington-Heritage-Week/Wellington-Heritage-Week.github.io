**Come and explore the New Zealand Police Museum with a special Wellington Heritage Week exclusive tour, delving into the police history of the Wellington region.** 

From stories of bravery and policing excellence, to important New Zealand events in our social history like the 1981 Springbok tour. 

The Wellington region has been witness to a long and rich history involving police and the amazing work they have done for their community, and at times the tragedies that have occurred. 

A perfect tour for both Wellington history aficionados, and those more generally interested in the region.

The museum is open between 10am and 5pm, seven days a week (excluding Good Friday and Christmas Day).
