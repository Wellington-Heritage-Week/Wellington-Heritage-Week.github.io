**Structural engineer Alistair Cattanach of Dunning Thornton will give an illustrated presentation about their development and implementation of seismic strengthening solutions for a number of significant Wellington heritage buildings. Examples will include Old St.Pauls, The Public Trust and Shed 13 among others.** 

Alistair is passionate about architecture and believes in the multi-discipline approach to design of appropriate seismic strengthening solutions. Alistairâ€™s knowledge of the non-structural disciplines allows these opportunities to be fully explored. 

Alistair, and the team at Dunning Thornton, have contributed significantly to the restoration and retention and strengthening of Wellington's architectural heritage. 

Futuna Chapel is a Listed Heritage Building Category 1 building and the masterwork of architect John Scott. 

NZ registered architects attending this presentation will received 10 CPD points.
