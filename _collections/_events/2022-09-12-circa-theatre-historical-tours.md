**Discover and celebrate the 46-year history of Wellington’s iconic Circa Theatre through a free, one-hour guided tour of Wellington’s foyer and backstage area at 1 Taranaki St.**

A Circa Councillor will take you on a unique guided tour of the ground level of this historic building, including rarely seen backstage areas. Learn about the fascinating building move from 7 Harris Street to 1 Taranaki Street – including how the facade of 120-year-old Westport Chambers was trucked across the road and the new theatre built in behind it.

Please note, at this stage, the tour will be on the ground level only - which includes our foyer, two theatres, backstage and outside.

The one-hour tours will run at 1pm daily from Mon 24 – Fri 28 October and there will be 4 tours on Sat 29 October at 11am, 12pm, 1pm, & 2pm.
