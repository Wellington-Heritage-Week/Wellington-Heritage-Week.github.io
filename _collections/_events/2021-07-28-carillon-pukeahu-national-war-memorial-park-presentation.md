**Learn about the history and importance of the magnificent 50 metre National War Memorial Carillon.** 

Opened in 1932, the Carillon's original 49 bells rang out across the city and it was the only building of the NWM for over thirty years, until the Hall of Memories was completed in the 1960s. The iconic Carillon is the world's third largest of its kind and its 74 bells range in weight from a few kilos to over twelve tons. 

Timothy Hurd QSM, the National Carillonist, has over 35 years of caring for the Carillon and will give a presentation of how this enormous instrument came into being and how the Carillon is played.

The tour is limited to 40 people â€“ so book your place early!
