**Otaki Museum River Exhibition: ‘Ko Ōtaki te awa, ko Ōtaki te kāinga – Ōtaki is the river, Ōtaki is the home’**

This exhibition tells stories of the history of the Ōtaki River – the relationship between the river and mana whenua, the early settlers, the current Ōtaki community. 

It features the strong links with Ngā hapū ō Ōtaki, the role of DoC over the years, recreation, sawmilling, gardening, gravel extraction, and the Tararua Forest Park. 

The contribution of the friends of the Ōtaki River is also displayed.
