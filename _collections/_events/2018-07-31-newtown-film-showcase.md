Take a ride on an elephant, ferris wheel, or the last tram to Newtown in this screening that showcases Newtown and its surrounds, drawn from the collections of Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision. 

Join us to take a step back in time to how Wellington used to be. Home movies, documentaries, television items and some of the earliest films made in New Zealand feature in this programme that take in the significance of Newtown Park as a place for official ceremonies, Springbok Tour protests at Athletic Park, and everyday occurrences such as rubbish collection in the 1930s. The silent parts of the programme will be accompanied by live music. 

There will be two screenings of the films:

* 2pm & 6pm Tuesday 23 October at the Newtown Community and Cultural Centre Hall (Cnr Rintoul & Colombo Sts) 
* 4:30pm Saturday 27 October at Nga Taonga Sound and Vision (84 Taranaki St, Te Aro, Wellington)

**Booking via Eventfinda. Door sales are available. **

**Cost:** $5
