**During the first four decades of the 1900s, Te Aro was seen as a ‘disease ridden’ slum, with 10,000 residents crammed into small dwellings. In the 1920s, the motor car and planning rules began to transform the area.**

Dr Richard Norman, formerly with the School of Business and Government at Victoria University of Wellington will use a new model of Te Aro from the 1920s and photographs to show stages of change to now when Te Aro has more than 15000 residents, mostly in high rise apartments.
