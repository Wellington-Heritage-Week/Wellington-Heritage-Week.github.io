Celebrate 125 years of womenâ€™s suffrage with a special exhibition at Wainuiomata Museum. 

Then take the Heritage Hunt from Wainuiomata Museum to Wainuiomata Pioneer Church and Churchyard. Discover the Wainuiomata women who registered to vote in 1893 and go in a draw for prizes (adults and children).

The Wainuiomata Museum is located in one of the oldest purpose-built school buildings in the Wellington region built by James Burrow in 1908. The original 1908 room has been converted into a classroom with wooden desks from several periods, slates, blackboards, books and school journals. It is here that children can experience schooling of past years and is unique in the Wellington region.

A 1938 addition contains household implements, clothes, tools, photographs, and paintings used in or depicting life in the Wainuiomata Valley in years gone by. Many items have been donated by descendants of the early settlers.

**No booking is required.**

**Location:** 1 Homedale Road, Wainuiomata (in the grounds of the Wainuiomata Primary School)

**Cost:** Free
