  blurb: Christ Church Preservation Society was formed to take over the
    maintenance of the church and burial ground after a public meeting in 1950
    decided that the church building should not be moved by the Anglican parish
    to Stokes Valley. With the opening of the new railway in 1948 the church was
    cut off from and was no longer easily accessible to the Taita
    community.  The movement to preserve the historic church on its original
    site was one of the earliest examples of recognition of the value of
    historic buildings in Aotearoa New Zealand and the interest this raised led
    to the introduction of legislation and the formation of the Historic Places
    Trust.

**The historic Christ Church at 73 Eastern Hutt Road, built in 1854, will be open, without charge, from 1 to 4pm on Sunday 30 October 2022, with guided tours of the graveyard.**

The church, which is a Category 1 Historic Place, is maintained by the Christ Church Preservation Society, although still a consecrated Anglican church with an authorised burial ground. It is the last resting place for many  Hutt Valley families.

More information is available on our website, including searchable family histories and other documents, along with a virtual walk-through tour of the church and graveyard which allows for linking of graves to family names.
