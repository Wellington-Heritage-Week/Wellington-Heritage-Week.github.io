**This unique tour will engage visitors in a completely different Kapiti Island experience. Visits to historically rich occupation sites, Maori settlement, whaling and farming remnants, followed by the remarkable conservation story of the Kapiti Island Nature Reserve, and Marine Reserve.** 

The tour is a combination of cruise/visit and on-island walking-approx 2 hours cruising and 4 hours on the island - expert local guides will bring rarely exposed highlights and moments, not routinely experienced on a Kapiti Island visit. 

Lunch is included on Island. Early/advanced bookings are essential as participating numbers are limited to 24 per tour.

Please meet at 8:30am at Kapiti Island Centre, 29 Marine Parade, Paraparaumu Beach.
