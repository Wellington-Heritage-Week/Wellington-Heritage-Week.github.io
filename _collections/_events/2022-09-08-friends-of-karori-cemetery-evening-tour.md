**Evening Tour. Would you like to join us and explore the beauty of Karori Cemetery in the evening?**

This tour is for anyone who would like to see the Cemetery through a different lens, as the landscape settles in from dusk to darkness.

On this walk you'll be accompanied by two guides who will take you on a wander through some of the most magical parts of the cemetery, with a story or two of early Wellingtonians along the route. We might even spy a Ruru/Morepork or two!

The tour does not have any scary themes. There are points on the tour where we may pause and turn off our torches to enjoy the landscape in the darkness.

Each attendee needs to bring their own torch.

The route mostly follows paved surfaces but there are some areas of unevenness. A moderate level of fitness and surefootedness is required.

The tour is not suited for children under the age of 12 or unaccompanied minors.
