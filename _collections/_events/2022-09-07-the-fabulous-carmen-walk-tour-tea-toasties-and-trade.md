**Entrepreneur, entertainer, madam, and mayoral candidate Carmen Rupe was based in Wellington for less than 15-years but has left us a rich legacy of memories and inspiring moments.**
 
Join us on this free 90-minute community walk-tour as we trace Carmen's Wellington years (1967-1980). We'll visit some of the remaining inner-city business locations and imagine some of those that are no longer here: Le Balcon, Carmen's International Coffee Lounge, The Peacock, Cleopatra's Coffee Lounge, Carmen's Bazaar, The Gazebo massage parlour, The Cottage brothel and Carmen's Curio Shop.

Learn about Carmen's landmark 1966 court case, her race to become Mayor of Wellington in the 1970s, and how she supported and offered a safe harbour to Wellington's Takatāpui LGBTI Rainbow communities.
