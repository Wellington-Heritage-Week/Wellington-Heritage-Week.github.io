**Over a century of French language and culture in the heart of Wellington.**

Leading members of the Alliance Française Wellington will meet visitors at the door, and spend an hour talking with them (in English) about the work of the organisation and its relations with the Wellington community and other NZ cultural organisations. 

Visitors will be able to view the classrooms, the digital technology used for teaching and administration, and look at some of the resources in the library, with a cup of tea or coffee. 

They will meet some of the French teachers who can tell them about the experience of living and working as a foreign-language teacher in New Zealand.

Tours start on the hour from 10am. The last tour starts at 2pm.
