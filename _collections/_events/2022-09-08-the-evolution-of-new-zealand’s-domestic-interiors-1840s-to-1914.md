**Join us for a special Heritage Week event. Victoria University PhD candidate Eva Forster-Garbutt will discuss the changes in the interior layout and design of our early homes, between 1840 and 1914.**

This research draws on existing knowledge, early photographs, the work of heritage professionals, and her research on interior decorative linings. Case studies of Wellington homes, including Nairn Street cottage, will be used to show these changes in the local context.

The talk will be followed by a guided tour of Nairn St Cottage.
