**Inspire Art Gallery in collaboration with Wainuiomata Museum and the local Wainuiomata community, will be displaying items of historical value belonging and collected by locals about Wainuiomata’s rich history.** 

On Sunday 1 November, visitors can be taken to the nearby Wainuiomata Museum where they can also experience the well-preserved items within the Museum and meet the Museum curators. The Museum is only open on Sundays between 2-4pm by arrangement. 

Inspire Art Gallery is based in Homedale Village in Wainuiomata. The gallery welcomes local artists to exhibit and sell artwork. Visitors can enjoy the spacious oasis and take time to engage their senses as they view each art piece.

The Wainuiomata Museum is situated within two classrooms in the grounds of Wainuiomata School. One room is set up as a period classroom and the other holds historic articles on life in the Wainuiomata Valley.

The museum is run by Wainuiomata Historical Museum Society Incorporated

A wonderful child and family-friendly event.
