**View the exhibition 'The North Road' featuring colonial artists' work of the northern suburbs c.1850, and browse the Society's library and large collection of black and white historical photographs of the area.**

The Centre, called KATE, derived from its origins the Khandallah Automatic  Telephone Exchange, is a Registered Category 1 building with Heritage NZ. 

There is easy parking on Khandallah Road and the Johnsonville suburban train service provides transport to the Simla Crescent Station almost opposite the Centre. The travel from Wellington Central through the historic  tunnels makes it an historic  journey and a fun ride for children.

Group bookings for a personal guide to the Society's archive are welcomed. Please contact the Society to book tours.
