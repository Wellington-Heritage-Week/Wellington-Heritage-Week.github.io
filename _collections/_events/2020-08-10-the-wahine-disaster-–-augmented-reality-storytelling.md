**Join Hiamo on a walking tour of the Wellington waterfront, where we will explore the events surrounding the sinking of the passenger ferry, T.E.V Wahine, in Augmented Reality (AR).**

Using a smartphone’s camera and our application you will be able to view 3D visualisations of the events leading to the disaster. We will explore the story using AR to enhance engagement and look into how technology can help to share heritage stories and teach history in a new way.

Come to learn more about these events and the people involved, hear about Hiamo’s work, and discuss the uses of augmented reality in the heritage space.

Meet outside Te Papa’s front entrance, look for the people in the white and orange Hiamo shirts!

Maximum of 20 people per tour.

Tours hosted 1pm and 4pm on Monday 26 October and Sunday 1 November.
