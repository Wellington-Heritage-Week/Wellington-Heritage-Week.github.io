**Hear the stories of Wellington’s important mid- to late-twentieth century buildings, structures and places on the Modern Wellington Walking Tour. We’ll explore the huge changes, culture shifts and controversies created by all that concrete, steel and glass!** 

The tour of the central city starts at 1pm on Sunday 1 November and attendees are encouraged to gather from 12:45pm at the Protoplasm sculpture, at the intersection of Lambton Quay, Hunter and Featherston Streets.
