**Hear the stories of Wellington’s important mid- to late-twentieth century buildings, structures and places on the Modern Wellington Walking Tour. We’ll explore the huge changes, culture shifts and controversies created by all that concrete, steel and glass!** 

The tour of the central city starts at 1pm on Sunday 1 November and attendees are encouraged to gather from 12:45pm at the Protoplasm sculpture, at the intersection of Lambton Quay, Hunter and Featherston Streets. 

This is a free walking tour, but you will need to book by contacting Heritage New Zealand’s Central Region Office, because places are limited. 

Book by emailing: infocentral@heritage.org.nz. Please be sure to specify you want to attend the Modern Wellington Walking Tour when you book. 

The tour will take approximately 1.5 hours, so comfortable walking shoes and weather appropriate clothing/protection is essential.
