Visit the historic Dominion Observatory where New Zealand's time was determined using astronomical observations, a gun battery was built to ward off the threat of Russian invasion, and the site of New Zealandâ€™s first seismic research.

Built in 1907, this Edwardian Baroque style building is a fine example of our historic heritage after receiving a facelift in 2003 which included earthquake strengthening, structural repairs and refitting. 

Situated in Wellington's Botanic Gardens the wider site includes the cable car, views over Wellington City and the harbour, a World War One German Krupp gun, and Space Place at the Carter Observatory. 

**No booking is required.** 

**Location:** Wellington Botanic Gardens, 34 Salamanca Road, Wellington.

_Follow one of the many tracks through the Botanic Gardens or catch the cable car from Lambton Quay and follow the signs._

**Cost:** Free
