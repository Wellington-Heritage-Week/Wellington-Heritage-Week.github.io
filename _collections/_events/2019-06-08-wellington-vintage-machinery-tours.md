    Wellington Vintage Machinery was established in 1987 when one of the locals
    enlisted the help of another to get a small Lister engine operating that he
    had rescued from his grandfatherâ€™s milking shed. Once the engine was
    operating, these men plus another realised that they had a common interest
    in rescuing, restoring, and operating old engines so they decided to form a
    Club.  Since then many old machines and other items have been rescued from
    the scrap heap and brought back to life.  Many of the smaller machines are
    also taken out to public events.

**Tour vintage machines and test your operating skills at Wellington Vintage Machinery Incorporated.**

The tour will feature vintage machinery, tractors, and a hands-on experience getting them operating. Many machines on display are associated with Upper Hutt and are connected to its past.

The tour will also feature a nostalgic trip through the vintage kitchen and other displays of household, and retail items from the past.

The Wellington Vintage Machinery Incorporated is housed in a former cheese factory built in 1925. The factory has had an interesting past being used as a milk bottling plant then a munitions store during the Second World War.

It is one of the few remaining dairy factories designed by architects Duffill & Gibson of Hawera and built by CE Roebuck of New Plymouth.

Most of the display area is wheelchair accessible with disabled toilet facilities available.

There is limited on-site and road side parking.

Suitable for all ages. Group visits are welcome. 

Tea / coffee refreshments also available.
