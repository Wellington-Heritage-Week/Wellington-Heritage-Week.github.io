    Walk Wellington is run co-operatively by a team of trained and experienced
    volunteer guides. Each guide has their own particular interests, for example
    local history, attractions, architecture, built and natural environment, and
    all are trained to give an absolutely, positively, fantastic general
    introduction to New Zealand’s Capital City. All guides are passionate
    Wellingtonians and love to have a chance to show off their home town.
