  blurb: The Sisters of Compassion were founded by Suzanne Aubert at Jerusalem –
    Hiruhārama on the Whanganui River in 1892. For more than a century the
    sisters have taught, nursed, and provided homes for children, the sick and
    the elderly in New Zealand and the South Pacific. One of the sites linked to
    the Sisters is their creche, which is currently used by the Ministry for
    Culture and Heritage as their Education Centre.

**A talk by the Pukeahu educators and Sisters of Compassion on the historic backdrop and social conditions that led to the founding of the historic creche at Pukeahu.**

One of the few remaining buildings directly associated with Suzanne Aubert has been restored and occupies a prime position in Wellington’s new Pukeahu National War Memorial Park. The historic crèche building was constructed in 1914, beside the old St Patrick’s College, and is one of New Zealand’s first dedicated childcare buildings. Suzanne Aubert and three of her Sisters of Compassion came to Wellington in 1899 and rented a cottage at 22 Buckle Street.

The crèche building is currently designated for use as an education centre, administered by the Ministry of Culture and Heritage.
