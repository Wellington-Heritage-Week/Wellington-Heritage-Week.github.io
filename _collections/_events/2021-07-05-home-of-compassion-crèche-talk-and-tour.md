**“Without a doubt, the best run day nursery in Wellington.”* Come and discover the stories of Aotearoa’s longest-running crèche.** 

The desperate social conditions that led to the founding of the crèche by Suzanne Aubert Meri Hōhepa in 1903, will be explored by historians from the Ministry of Culture and Heritage. Sisters of Compassion will tell just some of the stories of care and community that happened inside the walls of the crèche buildings at Buckle and Sussex Streets. 

Following the talk there will be a guided tour and time to explore the 1914 historic crèche that is now home for the Pukeahu Education Centre.

Limited to 30 people.
