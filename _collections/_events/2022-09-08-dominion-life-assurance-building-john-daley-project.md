**Timed to coincide with Wellington Heritage Week, Page Galleries has installed an image from New Zealand photographer John Daley (1946 – 2012) in their window at 42 Victoria Street.**

Daley’s 1968 black and white photograph depicts a figure sweeping the original arcade of the Dominion Life Assurance Building, once occupied by several small businesses including a camera store, a café, and a barber shop, and which is today home to Page Galleries.

This project acknowledges photographer John Daley (1946 – 2012), whose work is held in the collection of Te Papa Tongarewa, as well as the history of the Dominion Life Building, designed by architect Stanley Fearn (1887-1976) in the 1950s.
