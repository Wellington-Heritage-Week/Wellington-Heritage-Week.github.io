**Built in 1878, this rail route between the Hutt Valley and Featherston is now a gently graded 18 km walk, run or mountain bike ride, with opportunities for camping, swimming and fishing.**

A rail route established in 1878 between the Hutt Valley and Featherston carried passengers up the steep incline from the Remutaka summit to Featherston until the opening of the Rimutaka rail tunnel in 1955. The innovative Fell mountain railway system pulled trains up the steep slope of the Rimutaka Incline.

The rail trail is a gently graded 18 km walk or mountain bike ride. This makes it an ideal trip for families with children. The trail is also popular with dog walkers.

Interpretation panels telling the colourful stories associated with the former rail line have been installed along the trail which also features restored railway bridges and historic tunnels (take a torch).

There are plenty of photo opportunities along the trail, and a viewing platform located between the Summit and Siberia Tunnels offers a panoramic view of the old Fell engine route coming up from Cross Creek to the Summit.

Enjoy swimming and fishing in the nearby Pakuratahi River and picnic or camp in the pleasant surrounds of Ladle Bend and Summit.
