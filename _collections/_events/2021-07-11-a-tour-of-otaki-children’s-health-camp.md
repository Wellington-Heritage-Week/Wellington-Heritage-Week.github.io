Visit New Zealand’s first Health Camp, providing children in need with sunshine, exercise, good food and sea air. See how were they cared for, housed, taught and fed.

Image: The interior of the Rotunda at Otaki Children’s Health Camp was built in 1916 as an army hospital ward at Rotorua. In 1931 it was transported to become a dormitory at New Zealand’s first permanent health camp at Otaki Beach. Friends of Otaki Rotunda aims to restore its tent-like expanse as a community facility.
