**Visit New Zealand’s first Health Camp, providing children in need with sunshine, exercise, good food and sea air. See how were they cared for, housed, taught and fed.**

From the 1930s, Health Camps and their fund-raising Health Stamps became part of every New Zealander’s awareness. What happened there? Did the selected child residents love or loathe their stay at camp? At New Zealand's first permanent camp at Otaki Beach (1932–2018), you can explore the facilities and relive their experience.
