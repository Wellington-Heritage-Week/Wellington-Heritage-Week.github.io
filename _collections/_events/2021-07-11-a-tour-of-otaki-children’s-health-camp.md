**Visit New Zealand’s first Health Camp, providing children in need with sunshine, exercise, good food, and sea air. See how were they cared for, housed, taught, and fed.**

From the 1930s, health camps and their fund-raising health stamps became part of every New Zealander’s awareness. What happened there? Did the selected child residents love or loathe their stay at camp? At New Zealand's first permanent camp at Ōtaki Beach (1932–2018), you can explore the facilities and relive their experience.

**In order to give everyone the best possible experience, we will split the tour into two groups as follows, with a maximum of 12 in each group:** 

* 1:30-2:30: *Group One* for talk and tour
* 2:30pm-3pm to tea/coffee for both groups 
* 3pm-4pm *Group Two* for talk and tour.

Please let us know which group you choose when you book.
