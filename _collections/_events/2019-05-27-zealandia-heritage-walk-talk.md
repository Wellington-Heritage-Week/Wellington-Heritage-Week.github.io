  blurb: >-
    ZEALANDIA is the world’s first fully-fenced urban ecosanctuary, with an
    extraordinary 500-year vision to restore a Wellington valley’s forest and
    freshwater ecosystems as closely as possible to their pre-human state. The
    225 hectare (500+ acre) ecosanctuary is a groundbreaking conservation
    project that has reintroduced 18 species of native wildlife back into the
    area, some of which were previously absent from mainland New Zealand for
    over 100 years.
