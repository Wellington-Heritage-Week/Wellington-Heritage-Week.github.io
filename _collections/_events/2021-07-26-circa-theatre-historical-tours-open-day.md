  blurb: "As a leader of arts and culture in Wellington for over 45 years, Circa
    Theatre strives to bring quality playwriting, performance and creativity and
    the very best of New Zealand and the world to our glorious waterfront. Circa
    Theatre started life in 1976 after a breakaway group of actors and theatre
    practitioners decided a new way of producing theatre was required for New
    Zealand. Enlisting the assistance of others who worked outside of theatre, a
    new ‘less is more’ model was created and a pared-back theatre space was
    built in the Ilott Advertising building on the corner of Harris Street and
    Jervois Quay. In November 1994 Circa moved to its new premises at 1 Taranaki
    Street, next door to Te Papa. "

**Discover and celebrate the 45-year history of Wellington’s iconic Circa Theatre through a free, one-hour guided tour of Wellington’s unique waterfront building at 1 Taranaki St.** 

A Circa Councillor will take you on a unique guided tour of the historic building, including rarely seen backstage areas. Learn about the fascinating building move from 7 Harris Street to 1 Taranaki Street – including how the facade of 120-year-old Westport Chambers was trucked across the road and the new theatre built in behind it. You may even get the opportunity to glimpse this year’s Christmas Panto rehearsal, THE LITTLE MERMAID!

The one-hour tours will run at 1pm daily from Mon 25 – Fri 29 October and there will be 4 tours on Sat 30 October’s "Open Day" (11am, 12pm, 1pm & 2pm). 

Max 20 people per tour and bookings are essential. There will be opportunities to join as a ‘Friend of Circa’ at a special reduced rate of $50 for the year (normally $60).
