**Futuna Chapel, one of the jewels of Wellington's built heritage, will be opened to the public over the Wellington Heritage weekend.**

This building is widely regarded as the masterwork of its architect, the late John Scott of Haumoana and is a synthesis of Māori, European and NZ Pākehā building traditions.

This synthesis is greatly enhanced with the installed and permanent art works of eminent NZ sculptor Jim Allen who celebrated his 100th birthday this year.

This is an opportunity to see and experience the unique result of the collaboration of the architect and artist.

The Chapel is open to be explored and trustees will be on hand to welcome visitors, answer questions and help reveal the Chapel's secrets and stories.

The chapel will also be open on the 29th and 30th of October. Details can be found <a href="/event/futuna-chapel-open-weekend-1/">here.</a>

On Sunday 6th November, a talk on the Conservation and Restoration of Heritage will be starting at 2pm, so the open day will be closing. If you wish to attend the talk, you can find out more and book <a href="/event/conservation-and-restoration-of-heritage/">here.</a>
