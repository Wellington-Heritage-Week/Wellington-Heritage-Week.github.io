  blurb: Pukeahu National War Memorial Park is the national place for New
    Zealanders to remember and reflect on this country’s experience of war,
    military conflict and peacekeeping, and how that experience shapes our
    ideals and sense of national identity. Created in 2015 to enhance the
    setting for the National War Memorial, the park is a public gathering space
    for ceremonial occasions. The park is also a place for memorials from
    countries with which New Zealand has a shared military heritage. Pukeahu is
    cared for by Manatū Taonga Ministry for Culture and Heritage.
