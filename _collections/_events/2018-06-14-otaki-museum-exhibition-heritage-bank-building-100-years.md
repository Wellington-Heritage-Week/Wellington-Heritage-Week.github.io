Otaki Museum will be hosting a new exhibition: _Heritage Bank Building: 100 years_.

The exhibition will celebrate 100 years of the main Bank of New Zealand in the area. During the bank's tenure, bank business was conducted downstairs and the bank manager and his family lived on-site in the rear and upstairs parts of the building. 

Visitors will see equipment and furniture used during the bank's life and read stories about the staff and customers. From 1967, after the BNZ moved to new premises, the building was bought by the then Otaki Borough Council and used as Council offices for services and meetings until 1989. For the next nearly 10 years it housed the new Kapiti Coast District Council Otaki Service Centre. A large community campaign resulted in the building being retained and renovated and it now houses the town's museum, run by the Otaki Heritage Bank Preservation Trust.

**No booking is required.**

**Location:** 49 Main Street, Otaki

**Cost:** Free

**Regular Open Hours:** Thursday - Saturday 10am - 2pm
