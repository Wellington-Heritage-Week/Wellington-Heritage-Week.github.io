**Nation Builders: Our City, Our Country, Our Heritage Tour.**

Meet some of the men who built our country – the engineers who designed and built railways, bridges, viaducts, ports and harbours; politicians and lawyers who provided the leadership and political frameworks; a surveyor whose detailed maps of Wellington are still used today, industrialists, a pre-eminent earthquake scientist, a judge of the Supreme Court, and a Premier (4 times!) during the 1880’s.

*Note: parts of this tour has previously been featured in our Movers and Shakers tour*
