**What are the environmental, health and comfort benefits from improving older houses rather than building new ones? Older NZ houses can be cold and damp, but does this mean that they have no value and should be demolished to be replaced by new buildings?** 

Using a selection of older New Zealand and international houses, this talk will explore the life cycle environmental costs and benefits of making older houses energy efficient, healthy and comfortable. 

Brenda and Robert Vale are internationally renown architects, writers and thinkers. Winners of the United Nations Global 500 Award for Environmental Achievement in 1994. they are authors of numerous books including "The Autonomous House", "Green Architecture", "The New Autonomous House" and "Time to Eat the Dog?"
