**See how transport has shaped our city on this year’s Heritage Week walking tour!** 

We will be moving through time, tracing tracks, trams, and trains. Join engineers on a journey around key sites in Wellington’s transport history on this 90-minute walking tour around the CBD. 

We will discuss how transport infrastructure has moulded the development of the city and what we might like the city to look like in the future. From pre-colonial pathways and streams to the latest ideas and issues in urban planning - discover Wellington through a new lens!
