**Brewtown found its home in the old Dunlop's Tyre centre in Upper Hutt. The buildings history dates back to 1949 and Brewtown has done an amazing job of preserving a lot of its history.**

Join us on a tour of Brewtown and learn about its history and the breweries which have taken something old and making something new.

Along the way enjoy a delicious lunch and beers from two of Brewtown's award winning breweries.

Brewtown is situated within the South Pacific Industrial park owned by developer Malcolm Gillies who bought the 36,000 square metre site in 2008, two years after the closure of South Pacific Tyres. Prior to the 2006 closure of the Upper Hutt plant, Dunlop was New Zealand's leading tyre manufacturer with a history in New Zealand dating back over 100 years. It played a key role in the development of New Zealand, providing not just tyres but a range of other rubber products needed for an expanding economy. The Dunlop factory had around 400 people working in it the day it closed in 2006. A similar number of jobs has been created across the businesses at the site today.
