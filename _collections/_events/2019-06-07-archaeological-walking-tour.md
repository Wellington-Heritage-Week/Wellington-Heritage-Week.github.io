**“What Lies Beneath: Wellington’s archaeology”.**

Mary O’Keeffe is an archaeologist and has been investigating Wellington’s archaeology for over 20 years.

In this guided walk Mary will take you to various sites in inner-city Wellington that she’s explored over the years and share the stories that each site has revealed.

Limited to 12 people. 

**Bookings are essential. Email mary@heritagesolutions.net.nz to book.**

**Location:** Commencing from the Te Papa forecourt, finishing in the vicinity of the railway station

**Duration:** 1.5 hours

**Cost:** Free

Note that both walks are the same and are a repeat of last year's booked-out event.
