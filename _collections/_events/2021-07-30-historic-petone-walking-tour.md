**According to Susan Butterworth “Pito-one was a fine place for Māori to hunt or fish but exposed to southerly storms and inconvenient for habitation. Yet here was where the NZ Company chose to establish the first settlement”.** 

Come and experience the fascinating history of this special place with people who are passionate about it.
