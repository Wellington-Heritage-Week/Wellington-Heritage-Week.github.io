**European settlers arrived in Wellington looking for big opportunities. Two such people to land on the shores of Te Whanganui a Tara in 1857 were William and Catherine Wallis. Visit Nairn Street Cottage to explore their stories.** 

William built their house in Te Aro, where they raised 10 children. Two more generations of Wallis women subsequently lived in the cottage. 

The house still stands today and has stood sentinel to rapidly changing times. The new exhibition experience at Nairn Street Cottage showcases the social and technological changes the house and its family saw over a century of occupation.

Celebrate this story with an Open Day as part of Wellington Heritage Week.
