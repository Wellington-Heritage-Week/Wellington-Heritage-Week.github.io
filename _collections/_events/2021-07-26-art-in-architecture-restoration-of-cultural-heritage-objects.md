**Italian trained art conservator Carolina Izzo will give a presentation on the restoration of the Futuna Christ Figure (2013) and the very recently completed restoration of the Stations of the Cross in Futuna Chapel, Karori.** 

Both of these art works are by the eminent NZ sculptor Jim Allen and are embedded into the fabric of the Chapel. Jim Allen celebrated his 99th birthday on 22 July 2021. 

Carolina’s presentation is the first of two events being held at Futuna involving leading NZ professionals who have contributed significantly to the restoration and retention of our cultural and architectural heritage here in Wellington. Carolina's presentation will be followed by a presentation by structural engineer Alistair Cattanach of Dunning Thornton Consulting Engineers. 

NZ registered architects attending this presentation will received 10 CPD points.

*The Trust would like to acknowledge the generosity of LT McGuinness in supporting this event.*
