A free heritage tour on the history of Petone from the 1800’s to today.

Join us in our heritage building to share stories of our past – and a lovely cup of tea. Together we’ll step back in time and tour through industrialisation, the settler’s ship Brittania and Te Atiawa’s long standing settlements around our beautiful harbour.  

 What will happen –visitors will be greeted in the Hall of Memories were their guide (Arawhetu) will welcome them and introduce the museum and history of the building. 

Heritage features will be pointed out and they will be talked through the 2016 upgrade of the building. Walking through to the foyer visitors will see some of the original heritage features of the space (booth, Women/Men on the walls, shower spaces) and get to see out to the harbour. 

The taniwha Ngake and Whataitai will be acknowledged and a brief discussion of Māori occupation in the area. Te Atiawa will be mentioned as the mana whenua of the area and then we walk through to the West wing and exhibition spaces. On the tour of our exhibition spaces we will share three historical or heritage focused points from each display. 

We’ll be finishing with a cuppa and bikkie in either the hall of memories or foyer.
