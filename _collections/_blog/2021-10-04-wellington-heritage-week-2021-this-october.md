The festival starts on Labour Day, Monday 25th October, with guided tours of Matiu Somes Island by the Eastbourne Forest Rangers, a guided walk into Khandallah’s Tyers Stream Reserve hosted by the Guardians of Tyers Stream, and a line-up of historically inspired beers served at a quiz night at Waitoa Social Club on Victoria Street.

The festival officially opens on Tuesday 26th of October at the City Gallery with a panel event featuring Cr Tamatha Paul, Mount Victoria-based urban designer Stuart Niven, and representatives from Live Wellington, Generation Zero, and the Urban Development Institute. The doors open at 5:45pm and the panel discussion starts at 6pm. It is followed by canapes and refreshments. The public is welcome to attend but must RSVP to ensure the 100-person capacity is kept.

Events continue through the weekdays, including daily tours of Circa Theatre, a tour celebrating 20-years of the Lord of the Rings at Weta Workshop, and themed tours of Karori Cemetery.

On the weekend there are plenty more events that explore modern architecture, engineering and infrastructure, virtual heritage, and industry, including a special historical tour of Brewtown that is in the former Dunlop Factory in Upper Hutt – a delicious lunch from the breweries is also on offer.

Festival Coordinator Alex Hockley says “our team are incredibly proud and excited about this year's festival. We have a range of new events with unique experiences from many perspectives. It is a great way to showcase the culture and heritage of Pōneke, and we cannot wait to share it with all of you!”.
