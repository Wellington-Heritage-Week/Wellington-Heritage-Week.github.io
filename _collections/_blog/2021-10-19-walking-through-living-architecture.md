Ask Dr Robin Skinner from the Wellington School of Architecture about the Kelburn Campus Walking Tour he will lead as part of Wellington Heritage Week and you can see his eyes light up. 

“This is the first time I’m taking the walk. I’m keen to see how it develops because people will share their stories along the way— some they’ve heard, some they’ve lived through, maybe they’ll set me straight on a few things. So many people have an involvement with our campus site,” he says. 

Professor Marc Aurel Schnabel, Dean, Wellington Faculty of Architecture and Design Innovation alerted his staff that David Batchelor, a current PhD student and festival director of Wellington Heritage Week, was keen to have guided walks during the event.
