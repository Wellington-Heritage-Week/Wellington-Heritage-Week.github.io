In our sixth year of running Wellington Heritage Week, it’s fair to say that our 2022 timeline hasn’t been the one you’ve grown used to, so we wanted to explain why.

While we expected to face several changes this year – a new director and trust, for example – there were still some unexpected surprises, good and bad, that came our way.

Our 2021 volunteers started new jobs, moved cities, and chased new opportunities in 2022. While this is all great news, it did mean they had to stop volunteering for the festival. They have all done fantastic work for us, and we wish them all the best. We know they’ll continue to do amazing things!

Unfortunately, this was followed by our director, Alex Hockley, catching COVID and going through a lengthy period of brain fog. With our reduced capacity, organising the festival had to take a pause.

Now, we are catching back up! Alex can think again, and we have some new additions to the festival team, who we cannot wait to tell you more about. While there will be adjustments due to the holdup – you will receive fewer newsletters this year, for example – there are some exciting changes too.

Wellington Heritage Week will be running for two weeks in 2022, between Labour Day the 24th of October and the 6th of November. This gives event hosts more flexibility in planning their events and allows visitors to experience more of our region’s heritage without rushing around town.

Speaking of event hosts, **registrations and applications are now open**, with some adjusted requirements to account for their delayed release.

Registrations of Interest are no longer required but are available until August 17th if you are not yet ready to submit a full event application.

Event Applications are required, but their due date has been extended out to **10pm, 31st of August**. Make sure to get them in before then!

You can find Event Applications [here](/form/2022-event-host-application-form/), and Event Registrations of Interest [here](/form/2022-event-host-registration-form/). If you would prefer to submit over email, download the instructional PDF [here](/assets/uploaded/wellington-heritage-week-event-host-information-2022.pdf).

Thank you for all your patience and for sticking with us for these upended Covid years. We will see you all in October, and we look forward to your submissions over the next few months!
