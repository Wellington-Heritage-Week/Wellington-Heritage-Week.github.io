The festival has undergone some changes since last year, with Alex Hockley, a 2021 Festival Co-ordinator, taking up the reigns as Festival Director and the festival expanding to two weeks between Labour Day the 24th of October and the 6th of November 2022.

Running the festival for longer gives event hosts more flexibility in planning their events and allows visitors to experience more of our regionâ€™s heritage without rushing around town. We know this has been frequently suggested in previous years!

With these changes, we have an extended deadline for event host applications. **Applications are now open and will close at 10 pm on the 31st of August**.

This deadline is a month later than previous years, providing us and the community with additional time to get ready for another festival of celebrating our people, places, and stories.

**Registrations of Interest for event hosts are no longer required** but are available until August 17th if you are not yet ready to submit a full event application but wish to be on our radar. We recommend registering your interest to host an event so we can plan for your inclusion in the festival and avoid schedule clashes.

You can find Event Applications [here](/form/2022-event-host-application-form/), and Event Registrations of Interest [here](/form/2022-event-host-registration-form/). If you prefer to submit over email, download the instructional PDF [here](/assets/uploaded/wellington-heritage-week-event-host-information-2022.pdf).

We are also on the lookout for volunteers to join our 2022 team and help with coordinating event hosts, running our social media platforms, and preparing our newsletters. If you are a whizz with technology and social media, please get in touch at [info@wellingtonheritageweek.co.nz](mailto:info@wellingtonheritageweek.co.nz).

Thank you for all your patience and for sticking with us for these upended Covid years. We will see you all in October and look forward to your submissions over the next few months!
