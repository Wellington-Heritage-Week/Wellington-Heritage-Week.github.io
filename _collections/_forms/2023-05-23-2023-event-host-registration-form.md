We encourage event hosts to showcase a unique and interesting story, person, or place from the Wellington region. It is free to be an event host.

While this Registration of Intrest form is optional, we strongly recommend that you submit one. Registering early allows us to help in planning your event, particularly around other festival event times, to raise your chances of receiving high attendance.

Event Application forms are required, and **must be filled out separately**, even if you filled out a Registration of Interest form earlier. Applications are due at 10pm, July 31st, 2023.

Once you are ready to submit your full Event Host Application, please head to this link:\
[Event Host Application Form (Online)](https://wellingtonheritageweek.co.nz/form/2023-event-host-application-form/)

This form will close at 10pm, June 30th. You will still be able to submit full event applications at the link above until the 31st of July.

*Wellington Heritage Week is volunteer-run and cannot guarantee funding to event hosts to support their events. Event hosts are solely responsible for the running and organising of their events.*

*We endeavour to include all suitable events within the capacity of the festival. The submission of an application to become an event host does not guarantee inclusion in Wellington Heritage Week.*
