The form below is **required** if you wish to be an Event Host for the Wellington Heritage Week 2023 festival. It must be completed before the deadline.

We encourage event hosts to showcase a unique and interesting story, person, or place from the Wellington region. It is free to be an event host.

If you have previously filled out a Registration of Interest form, please note that you are still required to fill out an Application form as well.

*Acceptance into the festival is at the provision of all the requested information to a satisfactory standard and subject to the capacity of the festival.*

*Wellington Heritage Week is volunteer-run and cannot guarantee funding to event hosts to support their events. Event hosts are solely responsible for the running and organising of their events.*

*We endeavour to include all suitable events within the capacity of the festival. The submission of an application to become an event host does not guarantee inclusion in Wellington Heritage Week.*
