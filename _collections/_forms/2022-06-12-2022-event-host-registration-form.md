This form is recommended if you are not yet ready to submit a full [Event Application](https://wellingtonheritageweek.co.nz/form/2022-event-host-application-form/). Registering early allows us to help you in planning your event.

By registering early, we can advise you if your event is being planned for a busy day of the festival, has extra health & safety concerns, and more. Addressing these issues early increases your chances of being included in the festival, and is appreciated by our team too!

Event Application forms **must be filled out separately** and are due at 10pm, August 31st, 2022.

Once you are ready to submit your full Event Host Application, please head to this link:\
